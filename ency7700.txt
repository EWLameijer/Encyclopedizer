#Expectancy: [#Franzen16] Expectancy, what you expect a behaviour to produce, is also influenced by what you see others get {EW: role models?} [#STeel146] Expectancy can be increased via success spirals, vicarious victory (role models, speeches?), and mental contrasting. [#SteelArt] Expectancy (like perceived value) increases the closer you get to the reward; after all the chance of success seems greater then.

#Humble brag: disclosing information about the self is intrinsically rewarding.

#Rewards: [#EW/Zimbardo] “A reward a day makes work out of play” {or is it lack of control? Scientists with kind of 'Ferris Buellers days off'}But is this strictly true? It may indeed be, as Persaud says, that rewards have informational value and that may explain part of the effect. However, one could also consider that work is created by the fear of not getting the reward, or, in normal work circumstances, the fear and focus on punishments. [#Ster75] Expecting a reward also makes work less original. [#Ster78] High-ability student's scores decrease with reward, those of low-ability students increase, however. [#EW] Perhaps everyone need a reward or a pleasant experience from time to time, else you may get burnout or depression. [#Ster302] Even getting a reward before doing something creative reduces creativity. Even thinking about extrinsic motivators may already inhibit creativity. [#EW] Would people learn if they are thinking of the reward? {EW: would reward/dopamine ensure that a certain action and reward are linked to a certain situation?} [#RietVU] Managers usually try to influence people's behaviour by talking to them (incite/encourage). Rewards and punishments work much better, note that punishments discourage initiative and creativity, though. {EW: like incompetent generals?}; small rewards, social (compliments) and immediately following upon performance work much better (Rietdijk even recommends purchasing a 'compliment counter') [#NRC200299] Rewards diminish a natural dislike of significant effort, and children rewarded for working hard at a language test will also work harder on a maths test. [#Nettle90] Social contacts are also quite rewarding, especially so (like all rewards) for extraverts. [#Steel74] We work harder for rewards when they are unpredictable but instantaneous. [#DPink55] Even the prospect of rewards [food, sex] activates the nucleus accumbens, making us likely to switch from risk-averse to risk-seeking behaviour. Rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation for dull tasks because there is no intrinsic motivation to be undermined. If you need rewards for nice tasks, try 'now that' rewards instead of 'if then' rewards; but don't do the 'now that' so often that people will expect it, they'll become 'if-then' rewards then. Or just give positive feedback, which can enhance intrinsic motivation. Useful feedback also. [#McGon123] Unpredictable rewards are more powerful than certain ones. [#Redirect94] Rewards don't undermine motivation when motivation is zero to begin with. Rewards that are contingent on doing well are also less likely to undermine intrinsic motivation than rewards for 'just doing it', but can still be problematic because they focus attention on the incentives and raise anxiety about being evaluated. “Minimal sufficiency principle”. Note that you can start higher, but later dial back rewards a bit, making it harder to attribute their actions to threat or reward. [#NS121209] Apparently, brain areas involved in reward and motivation are activated when an avatar follows your gaze. [#NS121013 “Reflections on the Musical Mind”] Expecting or listening to music dopamine is released in the regions of the brain involved with the organisation of action: it boosts our ability to attend to important matters and to disregard trivial stuff. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2014/sociale-context-belangrijk-voor-werking-puberbrein.html?utm_source=140708-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=sociale-context-belangrijk-voor-werking-puberbrein&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Adults' reward center is as active when winning rewards for themselves or a good friend; adolescent's reward center is more active than adult's, but only when winning results for themselves [boys] or themselves and best friend [girls]. [#Hooked] Like Mahalo showed, a reward must be of the right type (money may not work, especially if it is too infrequent or too little). Always ask: does the user or customer of this product have a need related to this reward? (reward – product/service relationship). [#Hooked100] There are rewards of the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe: desire to feel accepted, attractice important and included. Therefore, seeing someone being rewarded for a particular behaviour is likely to alter your beliefs and subsequent aactions ([Bandura]especially if that person is comparable to you or a bit more experienced). Rewards of the hunt: to acquire physical objects or information that aid our survival. Rewards of the self: mastery, completion, conquering obstacles. Sense of competency – bit of mystery can help. Note, though, that rewards can be too infrequent or small to matter.

$Adaptability: [#Csik72] Talented teenagers are less likely to perceive their families as rigid or structured.

$Adolescence: [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczT-GYJ9wY&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=6] Prefrontal cortex seems to grow and develop until early twenties (women) and mid-twenties (men), self-control however diminishes in adolescence since the mid-brain then powers up out of control (part of it fueled by testosterone, women have that too, though [EW: but perhaps still less?]). [#NRC-RonDahl] Adolescents have well-developed prefrontal cortex and active (even overactive) amygdala – but reward system is really hyper, so scary things feel very much more exciting. In early puberty (9-13) children learn what makes people 'successful' in society.

$Friendly world syndrome: [#NS140412] If we only hear the great fun our friends had (via Facebook's likes) we will start to think that other people's lives are much more exciting than our own.

$Friendship: [#EW/Juliette/Wim] Friendship, like learning, needs a relatively large up-front investment, but after than lower maintenance. [#EW] not only quantity of information exchanged, but also depth. [#Sommers187] Chance on friendship with people near you halves with every 19 feet separating you two. While friendships in the end will develop into deeper levels, proximity opens the door. Note that similar results go for people you like least: those are also most likely to be close by. [NS240514TheBrightStuff] Friendship decays: not seeing someone for a year decreases strength of friendship with about 1/3rd. Note that About half of our 150 connections are kin which do not change; other half change; but note that even if we can swap 'best friends', the time we spend with our best friend remains approximately the same.

$Obedience: [#Sidis] Obedience may be a great good when someone cannot comprehend a situation as deeply as an expert, however in some cases blind following-up-orders may not lead the desired result due to imperfect communication from the expert, and the many nuances in situations. Also, authority tends to stifle creativity and responsibility, leading usually to inferior motivation and worse results.

$Visual illusions: [#NS131110] Visual illusions may often reflect experience instead of innate brain biases; Western students have huge distortions on the Muller-Lyer illusion (arrow lines), the San of Africa have almost none, living in a world without carpeted corners.

'Cocaine brain': [#Gawan164] It's easy to get seduced by excitement or fear, and make foolish decisions to cut corners or disregard opportunities. Checklists and procedures help.

'Dutyizing': [#EW] trick to dampen enthusiasm for things like WoW, instate rules like “2x primary objective before 1x secondary objective”. Undutyizing (where, when, etc.) and

'That's not all'-technique: [#59sec216] Sales technique, in which a sale becomes better and better since the price drops and drops [because we're 'special'] and more and more 'free' things are added.

'Think out of your league': [#HTSWW56] Technique to help find out what you really want from life, which is usually more reasonable than you would think, but needs to be in the correct direction.

'What did you learn in school today?': [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/radical-teaching/201005/want-children-pay-attention-make-their-brains-curious] Parents asking their children what they learned in school today reinforce the learning, especially if they are interested and give appreciative feedback.

'What the hell'-effect: [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201101/autopsy-the-abandoned-new-years-resolution] Common in dieters, willpower giving away completely after a first small 'sin'. Can be addressed by self-forgiveness “Many people feel guilty after eating a donut, you might be too.” (be mindful of the feelings you have) Everyone indulges sometimes” (part of human condition, it's not you who is a loser) 3. So don't be too hard on yourselves. (or: what would you say to a loved one in this situation) People, after this, also take more responsibility for it, and are more amenable to feedback.

100%: [Schafer57] How do you know that your 100% is really 100%? And that you could give 110%?

4C/ID: [#Clar294] Sort of problem-based learning which has far-transfer tasks as the core of the lesson, supportive information for completing it, neafr-transfer tasks (procedural tasks) where they are needed, and drill and practice for skills that need to be automated. It's useful to first give a short preview of the whole-domain task before training the parts. Process-worksheets help, but mainly when presented before the problem, else cognitive load may be too high. Worked examples help too. Collaboration may substitute for worksheets, but is probably not superior to it.

72-hour rule: [#Schafer20] Start within 72 hours with a concrete action for your plan, helps against procrastination.

80-20-rule: Bert Weckhayer? Catalysis: people in the lab may work 80% for themselves, but 20% for the whole.

@ACT: [#HayesS] Acceptance and Commitment therapy

@Acting: [#Gall47] Getting into the role of a 'professional tennis player', acting as if you are one, improves performance already. {EW: like the scientist – quiz?} Also acting in another tennis style than you're used to expands your range (defensive players roleplaying a good offensive player, formal players roleplaying a good competitive player). {act as if... Checkov} Posture, movement, attention to body areas, muscle tension, can all help modify one's mood. [#Isaacson348] Many successful innovators pretended that they were absolutely in control, always acted like they could do something. [ part of their reality distortion field]. [#Lyubom261] Act like a happy person?

@Change: [#Loeh88] People trying to make a major change in their lives often fail several times before succeeding in finding a sustainable way. Important is specificity of timing + where and precision of behaviour. Do not say: I will NOT do such and such... rather prime: when tempted to … I will do X instead. But do not overburden your willpower with too much change at once. [#Tigg26] Generally, change is much slower and costs more trouble than we expect or want. Ideally, intentions and situations must be changed to change behaviour. [#Lieb76] Start with a small success, and focus on one thing at a time to improve, preferably the easiest first. Changing others requires you to like them unconditionally. [#HeaB93] For change, don't obsess about the middle, as it will look different when you get there, but look at a strong beginning {concrete action?} and strong ending {elephant-desire?}, and get moving. [#Hargit169] Future Nobel laureates and other great scientists change the subjects and techniques of their research in a variety of ways, common is the willingness and ability to change. [#JeWerktAndersDanJeDenkt/Leidraad] People often seem reluctant to change, but that is often because changes are imposed by superiors and are too frequent (a new change given while an older one is still being implemented). [HenkOosterling, NRC15062013] In every bureaucracy or government service there is at least one person who is not mentally killed by rules and procedures -you need to find those people, not waste your time on 'dead horses'. [#Weiner156] “The great affair is to move” -Stevenson. [#Seligm50] If you do something wrong, reflect in the evening how you could have done better. [#Lyubom293] Change is generally less hard than research suggest, as most people enrolled in studies are the particularly hard cases, and most people need several attempts in order to change an aspect of their lives, not one as is usually investigated. [#Patter9] Our primary problem is not that we are weak, but that we are blind (to the forces controlling us) [EW: but we may also not know the tricks to counteract them] [#10] We often try too few methods at a time. See/study the forces against you. (motivation, ability) * (personal, social, structural) -personal motivation: connect with your goals (especially during crucial moments) -personal ability: skills (like taking notes) -social motivation: role models  -social ability: having others help you or provide information -structural motivation: short-term rewards / visibility -structural ability: visual cues. Changers stumble as much as they succeed. Their change plan is homegrown. When and where do I give in to my urges? “Crucial moments”. Then make personal change plan/hypothesis. Then feedback/repeat. Analyze crucial moments: times, places, around certain people, in physical or emotional states. Establish rules when temptation comes – vital behaviors. Turn bad day into good data. Goal is not perfection, but progress. Visit your default future (including catastrophic possibilities). Tell the whole story (vivid, concrete), also for good actions. Use values/value words. Make it a game [p59] limited time, small challenge, a score. Create a personal motivation statement. Motivational interview -the future one likes to live, how one is going to get there, and so forth (see also ChangeAnything.com/exclusive). Are you misdiagnosing emotions (hunger=stress)? Then (skills) start with a skill scan (which skills do I need to execute the desired behaviour), employ deliberate practice (practice the situation, break skill into pieces, and prepare for setbacks) learn will skill (when in temptation, distract yourself, or think of your default future, for example). Also take accomplices into  account, anyone who may react negatively to you changing. Ideally, also find professional coaches (or a coach), and fans. [94] Redefine ‘normal’ - how do you want to live and feel / who do you want to be? Transformation conversation – talk with others. Focus on the effect that others have on you (never blame their intent). Also ask for assistance. Add new friends, and distance yourself from the unwilling. Some incentives incite behaviour that cannot be sustained (the ‘road warrior’ prize leading to high turnover), other incentives incite bad behaviour. Use carrots and the threat of losing carrots (loss aversion) In general, take incentives in moderation. Reward small wins. Biggest risk with any long-term change is not that you fail at the end, but that you drop out at the beginning. Reward what you do, not what you achieve. Build fences: do not go to places of temptation, and remove temptation from your home. Make certain activities intentional rather than default (requiring you to ‘hop the fence’ to do them) Make sure you are the one who builds and maintains the fence. Create your own fences by asking yourself what you reallu want and then put up barriers that help you achieve it. Manage distance: keep good things close and convenient, and bad things distant and difficult. Visual cues remind us of what we want, what to think about. So use environmental cues – but review them regularly! “Make it default”, like plan activities/dates in advance. Use tools like reminders. If tempted: slack off is permitted after mission statement (including default future?). Note that crucial problems change as you solve certain problems and new ones emerge. Sometimes vital behavior is simply the opposite of current behavior. Other times you need to find cases of positive defiance, when you functioned well. Don’t do exercise you dislike, find a good type for you.Be able to distract your attention for at least a few minutes (using your values, for example). “We don’t have to eat our mistakes.” “Where do you want (us?) to be in ten years? Where will I be in ten years if nothing changes? What are the advantages of changing? What do you intend to do?” “When I do this [behavior], I am putting [behavior] ahead of [person/value].” Personal motivational statement + say value out aloud + visualize default future. Just one more day. “You’re the rule, not the exception”. [#Catmul133] Dig for real problems (interns being perceived to cost money), may need some protection at first. [#152] Or, if people are afraid ‘just as a thought exercise, let’s suppose...’. [#Catmul294] (for companies) Notes day asked for ‘idea advocates’. [#Hofste] Change needs Machtspromotor and Fachpromotor, better not combined in same person. People moved as individuals will adapt to the new culture, in groups they will retain their own culture.

@Culture: [#Robi150] We are formed by our culture at large {EW: like the Curacao baseball fans, and the Dutch soccer hopefuls} Culture says what is possible and what is desirable. {EW: like status of scientist versus journalist} There are also local cultures which may or may not harbor someone's preferences (like homosexuals in small American towns). A culture may also lack specific role models (such as female architects). [#Erard203] Indians easily come to language classes but drop out quickly; few Japanese come, but they persevere for years. [251] There are quite some polyglots in Flanders, as it's quite prestigious to learn a foreign language. [#Sommers133] Inadequate law enforcement led to a 'culture of honor' in the south US, since not reacting to insults or slights was a recipe for further exploitation. [#Leidraad] Edith Schippers went to India as a student, and was impressed to see so many students with ambition, who wanted to be the best in their field. They worked very hard! In the Netherlands, people treated study as a side activity [EW: less advantage – get good job, better enjoy yourself and meet spouse...] [#EW] Would different cultures work because they add to your store of concepts? Or because they train mental flexibility (seeing a situation in 2 different ways?) Or both? [#SimonB157] In periods where Japan was open to the outside world, genius flourished. Note that it was mainly a g-2 effect: the knowledge took time to be translated and assimilated by the Japanese. [#Weiner84] Chinese students consistently underperform western students on creativity tests [#85] Or because of relatively more focus on usefulness, less on novelty? [#87] Chinese children find it hard to disobey their parents about anything. [#95] However, Chinese get much more creative than their base level if they get explicit instruction to be creative [EW: internal desire/tendency lacking?] [#138] “What is honored in a country will be cultivated there” (medicine in Edinburgh, philosophy, not cooking, in ancient Athens) [#EW] Would culture (relatyively efficient access to knowledge accumulated by others) define humanity instead of greater creativity? [#CultureBook] Culture has 6 dimensions: directness (note that in certain cultures, like China, superiors can be very direct, subordinates must be indirect), enthusiasm (how much positive emotion to show), formality (respect for superiors), assertiveness(own wishes versus giving others a choice/how much one expresses one’s own desires), self-promotion (skills and accomplishments), personal disclosure (how much to reveal about yourself in a certain situation). Also note power distance. Note that there is not one set for a culture, region, organisation and person/individual also have some influence. Also no exact target, more 'zone of appropriateness' (Note: in China: taking personal initiative is risky. Micromanaging bosses feel safer. Self-promotion: I'm good at this and I want this => also not wanted. Too direct.) To adjust, connect to personal goals, personal values, cultural values, other culture's logic. Japan: personal reputation and face are critically important: what we find important is influenced by what our culture deems important. Any aspect of [new culture] you like or admire (like sports). Sometimes you can blame your native culture. Build personal relationships Observe multiple people, otherwise risk of selecting wrong model Seek mentor, inside and/or outside. [#NS060517ChimpToolUseSpreadsLikeAFamilyTradition] Chimps mostly learn from their relatives, like children or parents, not from their “friends” (Chimps they spend time with) [#Paul25/EW] Would Dutch culture limit reproduction (in order to enhance social stability?). Culture uses/misuses biological pathways, variation between cultures (and change in cultures with changing circumstances) may be limited by that. Definitely needs some biological support (willpower). Culture also teaches us how to flourish, survive and reproduce in a certain culture/environment [Dutch may not do well in China, and the other way around]  [#Hofste8] Culture has four components: symbols, heroes, rituals (which form practices) and values [which cannot be observed from outside]. Values change much more slowly that outer layers like symbols/appearances. Note that people have different layers of mental programming (national, regional, gender, generation, social class, organisational), making their ultimate behavior harder to predict. Layers acquired later in life (organisational culture) are relatively easier to change. Schwartz distinguishes conservatism, hierarchy, mastery, affective autonomy, intellectual autonomy, egalitarian commitment, and harmony. Power distance: how easily people approach their boss, whether the boss is autocratic or paternalistic [instead of consultative], and the preference for the management style. Note that managers thought they had the style that they preferred in their own boss, but actually had the style that they saw in their own boss. Power distance is the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organisations in a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally. Students in high power distance countries find it important to have few desires, to do things in moderation, to keep oneself disinterested and pure. “No aspirations beyond one’s rank” Low on power: adaptability and carefulness. Note that institutions of a country are mostly influenced by middle-class values (which may not be the same as the lower class values). Note that occupation also influences PDI as much as country, but effect larger in countries with lower PDI. Note that people in high PDI societies also NEED that dependence. Low PDI: people need independence. Note that high PDI can lead to either large adoration or big despising of one’s boss. No struggling against misuse, but violent revolt if things get too bad. Note that PDI explains only 5% of corruption, 74% from poverty. Note that Confucius balanced obedience with protection and consideration. Marx ideas failed for a part because they were exported to high PDI societies, where the concept that power should yield to the law is absent. PDI associated with geographic latitude (south: higher), population size (bigger: higher) and wealth (decreases PDI). Collectivism vs individualism: collectivism: grow up in extended families, we vs they, very dependent on extended family, intermediary necessary until personal relationship is good enough. Individualism: friends chosen on characteristics instead of group membership. People are supposed to only look after themselves and their immediate families, instead of exchanging unquestioning loyalty for protection. In jobs, individualists like personal time, freedom and challenge most; collectivists training, good working conditions, and use of skills (‘what can the employer do for me’; though also because good working conditions may be taken for granted in wealthier countries – which individualistic countries usually are). In individualistic society, making and maintaining friends may be more important, as collectivist societies give friends ‘prepackaged’ with your family. In collectivist: filial piety, chastity in women, patriotism. Negatively correlated with PDI (so not really an independent factor => but correlation disappears when compensated for wealth?)  Individualism not really correlated with occupations, intrinsic vs extrinsic makes more sense (but does not make sense across countries). In individualistic societies, truth is important, even if it hurts. “Yes is yes, no is no”. Collectivist: extended families help pay for studies, but also expect part of earned salaries back. Family occasions extremely important in collectivist societies. And little need to communicate verbally; no such thing as an unwelcome guest. High-context vs low-context communication (most information in the physical environment or known to the persons). Also shame vs guilt. And (collectivist): face vs self-respect  In collectivist countries, men prefer their brides to be younger, wealthy, industrious and chaste (grooms are hoped to be older and wealthier). Desire for chastity depends more on poverty. Individualist cultures more often use explicit pronouns (like ‘I’) IDV correlates to extraversion. IDV people are better at recognizing happiness, worse in sadness (as countries encourage sharing said emotions). Walking speed also higher. IDV Consumers prefer detached houses, private gardens, caravans, pets (especially cats), do-it-yourself activities. Read more books, depend more on media than on social networks. Spend more money on healthcare. Handicapped in IDV try to be cheerful and live life to the fullest, in COL cultures they are mark of shame and kept out of sight. Collectivist culture: better small groups and spokesperson. Collectivist: learning is just for school. Sons in collectivist societies more likely to follow footsteps of father. COL: poor performance in workplace no reason for dismissal, one does not dismiss one’s child. In COL cultures, group incentives work better. Formal appraisal interviews unacceptable; rather by either witholding favors or via intermediary. Universalism vs particularism (one should treat one’s ingroup members better). Building trust goes first in COL society. Press freedom correlated with IDV, but even more by wealth, as people find it easier to disseminate their opinion. Human rights correlate most with wealth, only if wealth is high, IDV plays a role. Psychology in IDV/COL countries also differs, especially importance in-group out-group. Hunter-gatherer individualist, agricultural collectivist, industrial IDV (nuclear family). IDV correlates with wealth (71%) and geographic latitude. Wealth seems to cause individualism, not other way round. Masculine: ‘overselling yourself’, assertiveness vs modesty. For work: earnings, recognoition, advancement and challenge vs good relationship with manager, cooperation, living area, security. Men and women score differently,even within one country! In masculine society men should be assertive, tough and focused on material success, females modest, tender and concerned with quality of life; in feminine society everyone is supposed to behave to the feminine values. MAS related to mastery dimension: ambitious, capable, choosing own goals, daring, indepdentent, successful. Stress on ego vs stress on relationship with others – regardless of in-group (as in collectivist societies). Good samaritan had feminine values. Well-being vs survival IND+FEM vs COL+MAS. In MAS countries women are more MAS too, but men increase in MAS even more. As people age, MAS decreases, and is same for men and women after about age 50. Also from technical to social interests? Occupation more strongly correlated to MAS values than gender. MAS countries: husband should be healthy, wealthy, and understanding, while boyfriends should have personality, affection, intelligence, and sense of humor. Sex more of a taboo in masculine cultures, making it harder to inform for prevention of AIDS. High MAS: also less accepting of homosexuality. Feminine cultures seldom praise good performance or reward excellence. Sexual harrassment less of an issue in feminine societies. MAS: students will ask to redo an exam when getting low grades.High MAS: students kill themselves for poor performance more. Status purchases more prominent in MAS culture. MAS: buy more nonfiction books. More rapport talk (using conversation to exchange feelings and establish a relationship) among women. MAS: meetings are to assert oneself, show how good one is, FEM: meetings are where consensus is sought and decisions are made. High MAS: prefer to work for large  organisations. MAS: advantage in manufacturing, making things efficient and fast. FEM: consulting, transport, agriculture. FEM more permissive of things like euthanasia, prostitution, bribes, suicide. Are okay with integration (just get rid of unlawful behavior) instead of assimilation. More aid for poor countries. Higher MAS: political debate more adversarial, more mud-slinging. Protestantism is more feminine than catholicism, but every belief (protestantism, catolicism, islam, buddhism) has more masculine and feminine versions. Note that feminine countries secularize faster. No relationship between secularization and civic morality, female countries (+lower power distance) tend to have higher civic morality. Women get more male levels of religion when they get a paid job. Poorer societies are more masculine. Wealthier societies become more feminine, both because of ageing and because more women participate in the labor force. UAI: uncertainty avoidance index. Higher UAI: more (average levels of) stress, more very unhappy people (and entrepreneurs) in society. Anxiety has no object (in contrast to fear). Higher UAI: more suicide, alcoholism, accidents, prisoners, people describe themselves as more neurotic. Low UAI: more caffeine consumption, more coronary heart disease, psychosis, less caloric intake, people describe themselves as more agreeable. Aggresion and emotions not supposed to be shown, people appear dull, indolent. Higher UAI: more different ways of addressing people (tu/vous). See pollution and danger everywhere. Bigger and clearer gap between clean and unclean. Lower satisfaction with life, fewer children if society is wealthy. Less happiness. Higher ratio of doctors to nurses. Teachers are gurus,  must know everything. Incomprehensibility is good. May have ‘foolish rules’, but they still satisfy emotional needs! (so are not entirely foolish). Too low UAI: may seek consensus over truth. Low UAI may be better at innovation, high UAI at implementation. Acievement, esteem, security and belongingness needs may be related to low UAI, high mas, high UAI and low MAS respectively. High UAI: more laws, but procedures also longer. Low UAI: citizens perceived as more competent. Citizens also more willing to protest. High UAI: may help blind person sooner. But also more banned groups and terrorists. In science: high UAI: little data, strong theories/ theorists. In literature high UAI more factual (Kafka), in contrast to low UAI fantasy. Individual people can score high (or low) on both employee- or job-orientedness, or M and F. But in a culture as a whole, the average on one dimension competes with the average on another dimension. [#HaidtH233] Culture also serves as a kind of group selection, so the selfish gene is not the only party that determines what happens. [] Trompenaars: universalism versus particularism, individualism vs commutarianism, neutral vs emotional, specific vs diffuse (are you only Doctor for your students, or also in the supermarket), achievement vs ascription (competent people vs elder people), sequential vs synchronic (multiple things at same time), internal or external control. Or tightness vs looseness.

@Environments: [#Coyl151] At KIPP, teachers mention 'college' a LOT. The environment abounds in redirecting people to the Goal (Sistine Chapel effect). {anchor/support structure}[#John119] People like actors and academics can collaborate for a while despite external pressure to do it the conventional way, but after a while their energy wears out and they have to stop the partnership. {behaviour is not reinforced enough? Or extra energy of novely wears off?} [#Ster24] Often it is the environment that selects the 'best/most lasting' ideas of creativity, not the creator. So you can't see creativity as entirely the work of one individual and his/her teachers.

@Escalation of commitment: labor leads to love (origami).

@Exercise: [#EW] How one exercises his skill determines ones style as a writer or scientist. The Brontës really studied writing differently from Sand. [#Medi20] Exercise seems to boost brain power, even to in old age. Our ancestors must have walked about 15 km per day. Aerobic exercise seems to be the contributor here. [#Pers276] A little bit of exercise makes you feel more energetic, helps against light depression and may stimulate nerve growth in the hippocampus. [#NS280505] 3-4x a week exercise seems to increase school grades, especially in boys. Learning, concentration and abstract reasoning are increased by up to 15% in people who walk for 30 minutes 3 times a week; especially noticeable for older people. Also show far less decline than their sedentary peers. One of the best ways to grow brain cells. [#Hatt53] Exercise does slighly increase school performance, and taking time from regular subject to school exercise does not decrease performance; effects seem to be mediated by small positive effects on concentration and memory, and better classroom behaviour. Exercise seems even more beneficial when it is not supervised, or 'behavioral modification', children doing more sports. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200910/exercise-and-the-immune-system-stress-lesson] Bit of it boosts immune system, but 1h or more of intense exercise, especially without enough rest afterwards, depletes it. [#NS24032012] The immediate effect of exercise is however that your mind gets blurred, you remember fewer details {less oxygen? Less sugar?/attentional resources?} [#NS080111] Strenuous exercise (in any case in young women) leads to cognitive impairments later in life, possibly through lowering the oestrogen levels. [#NS250513] Would cognitive decline with age be due to decline in physical fitness? Walking 3x a week for 40 minutes brings connectivity in the brain in 70-year-olds to the level of 30-year-olds. [#NS270216WorkOutToBoostMoodAndMemory] After 20 minutes of vigorous exercise, both glutamate and GABA are increased. This lasts for aboyut 30 minutes, though base levels are increased in people who worked out in the week before. May help with memory performance. And possibly also against depression, as depressed people have lower levels of both glutamate and GABA. [#Lyubom255] Physical exercise gives less chance of depression relapse compared to medication. [257] Exercise elevates serotonin levels similar to Prozac [#NS220815CircuitTrainYourBrain] 2x1h weightlifting versus 2x1h brisk walking: both enhance spatial memory, weightlifting helps executive function and associative memory, walking to verbal memory. Could be because strength training increases IGF-1, which affects communication between brain cells, and promote the growth of new neurons and blood vessels, and decreases levels of homocysteine, and inflammatory molecule, while aerobic exercise increase BDNF. Structured/focused exercises are bad just before tests, but help long-term to do better on tests requiring concentration and ignoring distractions. Fit children also have larger hippocampi and basal ganglia. Also works other way around: games like Music Catch which improve attention, also improve walking speed in older adults. Coordination exercises like balancing, synchronizing arm and leg movements and manipulating props increase basal ganglia volume in older adults. Working memory increased by playground-like exercises (like climbing trees), which challenge proprioception (position and orientation of the body) with at least one other element, like navigation, calculation or locomotion. HIIT can curb cravings, at least hunger, likely by decreasing levels of ghrelin. Exercising in the heat also diminishes appetite (in cold: stimulates it!) Also helps against smoking, though also ‘normal’ aerobic exercise helps against that. Yoga and meditation shrink the amygdala and thereby reduce stress, taking a leisurely walk enhances divergent/creative thinking, even for a period afterwards. Improvised dancing (especially if you make unusual movements for you) also works for divergent thinking.

@Goals: [#Watt135] We should always have a goal in mind for our study, so we do not wander too far away. {EW: though we should be allowed to jot down inspirations regularly} You should consider a goal to be possible (for example the one-minute mile) as well as desirable. {EW: remember Remy's bald friend} Goals should be set specifically, and if possible process-based instead of performance-based (getting to know the customer's unstated requirements) EW: and goals help us to create feedback on our own performance. {EW: but role of play?} [#Gall13] You need a clear goal in your mind of your desired outcome. [#Robi128] Creative teams often have a specific goal, and stay together until the job is done, be it short or long (in contrast to a committee). [#EricB383] Pursuit of difficult and specific goals is related to high performance levels. [#EW/GoedeVoornemens] Social environment must be conductive to goals (people sharing your lifestyle and vision). Need a good why, concrete plans of actions, not values. People may not reach goals (or behave badly) because behaving badly gives some payoff, such as stress relief. Keeping positive thoughts (not: “I should stop smoking”), also about yourself. [#Clar348] Goal dimensions are challenge (high, low), focus (specific, vague), target (technique, outcome), achievement orientation (mastery, performance [=outperforming others]), drivers (intrinsic, extrinsic [=money, status]). Challenging specific goals are best for performance and persistence, technique goals lead to expertise, mastery goals lead to deeper learning. Intrinsic goals lead to less stress and more mastery orientation. [#Bran] {Would having a goal help one learn, or would it just divert attention by daydreaming when one should pay attention to the class?} [#Pers3] Most people think much about their goals, but barely about what persons they would have to be to achieve those goals. Specific, time/timetable <EW: under discussion since some people work poorly with deadlines and can better work in the “now”> Track progress, seek resources, make it difficult for yourself to back out by announcing your goals to people, make goal attainment strategy part of your routine, ask yourself why you have chosen your goal, check for goal conflict and learn from failure. Find a role model. A peer group (live or on the internet) can help too! Being future-oriented (being able to see what the results of your actions in the future will be) can help too. Beware of resource depletion, you should have enough time/money/knowledge etc. to achieve the goal. Conflicting goals, resource depletion and lack of monitoring may be the most common reasons for not achieving goals. [#Tigg81] Goals should be ambitious enough; the more ambitious, the better, IF they're achievable. Goals focus energy, give energy (when high enough), give persistence, and stimulate problem-solving. While changing, regularly revisit your goals to see if you are achieving them or that the plans themselves need be changed. [#Peal91] ' Should I want this goal?' is always a good first question. [#Whit44] Should be SMART, CLEAR and PURE. [#Scho103] Try not to focus on the goal, but on the tasks. Goals help concentration. [#Care] Greg Lemond had written out his goals [#ForsD34] Regularly writing down your goals and perhaps revising them helps too. And add feelings! [#Gold159] An incomplete goal is more motivating than one that has not begun, and the closer you are to completing the goal, the more effort you'll exert. [#More89] Setting a time goal for practice (' I will practice for half an hour') is less advisable than setting a outcome goal that is achievable but inspires you. [#Hatt164] Goals should be challenging rather than of the 'do your best' kind of goal. Specificness helps, but difficulty is main component. Performance of students with most challenging goals is over 250% higher than that of students with easiest goals! Commitment to the goal helps, but is not really necessary unless for special education students. Goal attainment also helped by self-efficacy. Personal-best-goals also help, especially specific, challengging, and perceived to be related to self-improvement. [#Hatt255] Schools that doubled performance did not so much increase instructional time, but did set high goals for performance (next to being deeply knowledgeable about student performance, using formative assessments, collectively reviewed evidence on good instruction, used time more productively, and led by leaders providing instructional leadership). [http://www.ericdigests.org/2002-4/goal.html] Specific goals are the best, unless they are too easy to accomplish. Short-term goals give higher motivation. Goals need not be self-set to be effective, as long as people accept the legitimacy of the goal. [http://faculty.washington.edu/janegf/goalsetting.html] Higher difficulty only limits performance if limits of ability are achieved or commitment drops. Four mechanisms of work. First, goals serve a directive function; they direct attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities and away from goal-irrelevant activities. Second, goals have an energizing function. High goals lead to greater effort than low goals. Third, goals affect persistence. When participants are allowed to control the time they spend on a task, hard goals prolong effort (LaPorte & Nath, 1976). There is often, however, a trade-off in work between time and intensity of effort. Faced with a difficult goal, it is possible to work faster and more intensely for a short period or to work more slowly and less intensely for a long period. Tight deadlines lead to a more rapid work pace than loose deadlines in the laboratory (Bryan & Locke, 1967b) as well as in the field. When people are confronted with a task that is complex for them, urging them to do their best sometimes leads to better strategies (Earley, Connolly, & Ekegren, 1989) than setting a specific difficult performance goal. This is because a performance goal can make people so anxious to succeed that they scramble to discover strategies in an unsystematic way and fail to learn what is effective. This can create evaluative pressure and performance anxiety. The antidote is to set specific challenging learning goals, such as to discover a certain number of different strategies to master the task. Making a public commitment to the goal enhances commitment, presumably because it makes one's actions a matter of integrity in one's own eyes and in those of others (Hollenbeck, Williams, & Klein, 1989) Subsequently, Locke, Alavi, and Wagner (1997) found that the primary benefit of participation in decision making is cognitive rather than motivational in that it stimulates information exchange. For example, Latham et al. (1994) found that with goal difficulty level controlled, participation in goal setting had no beneficial effect on performance. However, people who participated with others in formulating task strategies performed significantly better and had higher self-efficacy than those who did not participate in formulating strategies. The first is the amount of the incentive; more money gains more commitment. Second, goals and incentive type interact. When the goal is very difficult, paying people only if they reach the goal (i. e. , a task-and-bonus system) can hurt performance. Once people see that they are not getting the reward, their personal goal and their self-efficacy drop and, consequently, so does their performance. This drop does not occur if the goal is moderately difficult or if people are given a difficult goal and are paid for performance (e. g. , piece rate) rather than goal attainment. The effect size for goal setting is smaller on complex than on simple tasks, since not all people are able to find the correct strategy for a complex goal. Managers' ambition was a significant motivational predictor of number of promotions over the 25-year period. Howard (personal communication) noted that the core item in the ambition factor was a single interview question:"How many levels up do you want to go?" [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczT-GYJ9wY&feature=autoplay&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&playnext=1] We're especially tempted to use moral licensing when we have competing goals. [#59sec82] It helps to make a step-by-step plan, tell other people about your goal, think about the good things that will happen if you achieve your goal, reward yourself for making progress towards your goal, record your progress. [not focusing on role models, not trying to suppress unhelpful thoughts, not think about the bad things that will happen if you don't achieve your goal, not rely on willpower, not fantasize about the ideal outcome]. [#Steel32] Goals in abstract terms are less powerful than in concrete words. [#Steel84] Marketing focuses on the most concrete and salient characteristics of items [EW: salience in goals?] [#DPink50] Goals that people set for themselves and are aimed at attaining mastery are usually healthy. [#Franzen190] A goal is always a (surface) reflection of an underlying need. [#Root] (Eminent scientist said he tried to get twice as much done in a given time as isproper or customary. [#Davidson39] Hold a desired goal in mind and form a plan of action: may be in left prefrontal cortex [#Redirect68] People who focus on the process of achieving the desired outcome are more likely to achieve it than those who simply think about the outcome itself. [#Strien62] Nietzsche defined genius as 'being led/driven by a great goal, and the want to find means to achieve it” [#Burkeman173] We should beware of making goals so important that they become part of our identity, which leads to musturbation, making failure to reach the goal not just sad, bur catastrophic. [#CoyleT43/Einstein] “One must develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through one's greatest effort “ [#Coyle112] Keeping one's goals for oneself can help perseverance, as announcing a goal in public already feels like payoff. “Think like a gardener, work like a carpenter” (think patiently, without judgment, work steadily, strategically, knowing that each piece connects to a larger whole). [#NS300515] Cortical implants in the 'goal' areas work much more smoothly than those in the motor areas, likely because you can react faster and at a higher level of abstraction (not all those jerky details of how muscles should be controlled) [#McGon16] Gage made many plans, but abandoned them quickly [lost prefrontal cortex, perhaps also willpower?] [#EW/ElsDas] Goals are natural (seeing pie, or a lion) and dynamical. [#EW]  Als je doel is geld te verdienen en snel werk af te leveren, dan gaan dingen mis tenzij je goede gewoontes hebt en procedure-feedback. [Ricardo, Disk Magic] [#Lyubom226] Think of ways to make goals more interesting and challenging, try to value them more, identify with them more, and make them more meaningful. [#Catmul] The problem with low goals is that they don’t inspire. [#Catmul140] Hold lightly to goals, but firmly to intentions.[#295] “The future is not a destination, it is a direction.” [#Schmid293] “Be stubborn on vision, flexible on details.” Distinguish slow success from failure by iterating quickly and establishing metrics that can show you if you are getting closer to success. When failures mount and there is not apparent path to success (or ‘multiple miracles are required’) it’s time to call it a day. [http://observer.com/2016/09/how-to-learn-in-two-days-what-normally-takes-six-months/] Accomplishing goals may be hampered by lack of clarity/fear of the unknown. Goals with clearer paths may take precedence. [#Schmid222] OKRs (Objectives and Key Results] are not for business as usual projects, only for those things that need some extra ‘oomph’. Score is not saved, but getting like 70% is good (if you get 100% everywhere, your goals are too weak. Are measureable. Also, almost everyone does them, you want everything to think. Also OKRs help people from chasing competitors, which is the way to mediocrity. [#HaidtH83] Distinguish pre-goal attainment positive affect (the pleasurable feeling you get as you make progress towards a goal) and post-goal attainment positive affect, which is more of a feeling of relief, left prefrontal cortex reducing its activity. Achieving success only gives moderate and short-lived pleasure, so accomplishments seem like striving in the wind. You get more pleasure from making progress towards goals than from achieving them. [#HaidtH143] There are four main categories of life goals: work and achievement, relationships and intimacy, religion and spirituality, and generativity (leaving a legacy and contributing something to society). People striving for achievement and wealth are generally less happy than people who focus on the other categories. Having a higher degree of vertical coherence amoung their goals (long-term goals and short-term goals fit together) seems correlated to being mentally healthier and happier.

@Happiness: [#Csik95] Talented teenagers in general seem less happy, motivated and excited. Perhaps due to higher standards/self-criticism?[#Hold13] Happiness can always be achieved now, mainly by giving it attention. [#NS140511] Two copies of the long version of the serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR makes people twice as likely to say they're satisfied with life than people having two versions of the short allele. [#Hobbelt] Happiness is the feeling that you matter + quality of social emotionships [EW: positive pride + benefit of interpersonal strokes?] However, enjoyment (such as TV) can take precedence over happiness, leading to fewer social contacts. [#NS05112011] People with 2x the short form of Sert are more vulnerable to depression in a stressful environment, but get excellent communication and social skills in a nurturing environment. [#Steel97] Interpersonal relationships predict happiness better than wealth or health. [#Int27012012] Happiest jobs (VS): geestelijke, brandweerman, fysiotherapeut, auteur, kunstenaar, leraar, psycholoog, financieel adviseur, bedrijfstechnicus. NL: leaders, salesmen, insurance agents, icters, architects, teachers in higher education, secretaries, accountants, printers, fishermen. Autonomy seems to help, as well as a manageable level of challenge, support, variety, seeing your results [and contact with people?]. More education, more income and more prestige helps happiness in the USA. [#NS280712] Money makes you mainly happy if you spend it on others, from donating to charity to treating a friend on coffee. [#Redirect51] Basic ingredients of happiness seem to be meaning (making sense of the world), hope (optimism) and purpose. [#Newport205] In Newport's experience, happiness does not require a calling. [#Nass130] Happy individuals are more creative and are better at diagnosing X-rays (more correct and faster). [#Flourish16] Happiness consists of positive emotion, engagement (flow), meaning, positive relationships and accomplishment. (other people may also help to make you feel more aroused, so emotions may seem higher – contradicts Burns' lists, though). 'Steven, you look piqued. Why don't you go out and help someone?' Positive relationship: capacity to be loved [?] [#Flourish82] Students completing the Penn Resiliency programme have fewer doctor's visits, better diet and more exercise. [#Flourish146] More contagious than loneliness or depression, and works over time. [#http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/what-a-happy-cell-looks-like/385000/] Eudaemonicwell-being (Aristotelean, having a purpose) correlates best with the function of our immune cells (anti-inflamm: high antiviral, low anti-inflamm) [#Burkeman7] “Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you will cease to be so” -John Stuart Mill [EW: perhaps because analysis and numbers can dampen emotion?] [#Seligm16] Happiness is comprised of 5 factors that people seek out for their own sake (cough… well, evolutionary sake), “PERMA”: positive emotions, engagement (flow), (positive) relationships, meaning, accomplishments. [#EW] Note that mastery does not appear in Seligman's list. [#Burkem7] If you ask yourself whether you are happy, you will cease to be happy. [#NS101215HappinessDoesntLeadToALongerLife] People who claim to be happier do not seem to live longer than those who don’t, if you compensate for initial health disparities. Study is criticized that it suggests/only takes epicurean happiness into account, not aristotelean happiness… [#Lyubom288] If participants are not motivated to become gappier, happiness exercises do not seem to work [EW: because they are so happy already that their happiness cannot increase much further? Or because they skip the exercises? Or because they don’t pay careful attention or do extra thinking?] [#Haidt88] Happiness causes marriage. However, marriage and religion also increase happiness, we never adapt fully to dependable companionship. Note that ailments that grow progressively worse do affect happiness negatively, and on average, adaptation to disability is not complete. External conditions can matter. Noise: bad, especially if it is variable or intermittent. Long commutes, especially in heavy traffic, also bad. Lack of control or perceived lack of control also bad. Shame (feeling self-conscious about one’s body) too. Interpersonal conflict also bad, you never adapt to it. Actions generate happiness, like eating. Flow when physical activity, especially when combined with music or being with other people. Note that elephant tends to overindulge on pleasures, rider should streer it to more variety. Kindness and gratitude are better (gratifications)

@Interest: [#Eyse13] Archimedes was so fascinated with mathematics that he could forget to eat or bathe himself for days! Perhaps uncommonly strong interest is needed to succeed in something. [#EW] Probably yes, you need to wonder all day how to solve something; next to a gap you need to find it important (either directly or for what it'd bring you like fame). [#Clar343] There is situational interest (you're interested by a great presentation) and personal interest (you're interested in a certain subject, even if the presentation is dull) Sustained situational interest may lead to personal interest in the long term. Situational interest can originate from emotional and cognitive interest. While teachers can use both these methods; emotional interest is rather dangerous as people are easily distracted from the main learning objective. {EW: would many professors be boring because they are personally interested, but the students are not yet and need to become situationally interested?} [#Zill218] People's interest in talk shows does not depend much on the theme discussed, taboo subjects such as sex are as interesting as esoteric things and relationships, as long as they are brought in a personal story about a concrete individual, and authentic manner. [http://faculty.washington.edu/janegf/goalsetting.html] Challenging goals also increase interest in a task, as well as helping people discover pleasurable aspects of a task. [#Medawar13] It is not enough that a problem is “interesting” - almost any problem is 'interesting' when studied in sufficient depth. [#Will20] Interest is fragile; ideally you design your lessons around something that needs to be learned, and frame it as a question at the right level to make it a puzzle worth solving [and doable but not too easy with the background knowledge]. It's the question that piques the interest; demonstrate or show only when understanding will be near 'joke-level', that students are first puzzled but then the quarter falls. [#Hargit101] Sanger ascribes success in science in being interested in the work. [#Higbee71] It may be easier getting interested in something if you can link it to one of your current interests. Or try to find out – since the subject will be interesting to someone, what makes the subject interested for such a person. [#http://chronicle.com/article/Graduate-School-in-the/44846] They are excited by some subject and believe they have a deep, sustainable interest in it. (But ask follow-up questions and you find that it is only deep in relation to their undergraduate peers — not in relation to the kind of serious dedication you need in graduate programs.) [#SimonB96] Interests and values only have heritabilities around 0.30 [which would be a shock to Krekels!] [#EW] ask, after an observation or action: what was new? What did I learn that was new or different or unexpected? [#GrenzelozeInteresseSanneAkkerman] Interest is for a part caused by novelty, influenced by existing interests, one can ‘personalize’ by adjusting a story to address the interests of specific others. Short term interest correlates to ‘taakwaardering’ (task valuation?), self-regulation and study performance, long-lasting interest correlates to determining goals, identification, expertise development and competence, autonomy and (when shared with others)- connection. During highschool, interest in various school subjects diminishes, even in the first year of university education subject-related interest diminishes. In practice, interests can shift (one growing stronger at the expense of another, like biology to maths), become more specific (biology to cell biology) or disappear (interest in laboratory research disappearing after a few days in the lab).

@Learning: [#EWL/McK] Learning is acquiring a skill, either by oneself, or by instruction from a teacher or a book/audio/DVD. Some teachers help learning, others hinder learning. Having the right materials (computers, pens, writing) and environment (right temperature, free from distractions) for a task may also help learning, as would a healthy body and mind. [#McK] Teachers learn best by first becoming aware of their specific weaknesses and the mindset underlying it, then see the proper procedure demonstrated in an authentic setting, and be motivated to make the change. Doing most training in the classroom (Transfer!), having dedicated and expert coaches, principals are expert teachers and coaches, and peer coaching and planning. [#Watt72] A language is best learned with first a grammar in your own language, second with simple books, third with conversation with the tutor. [#Wolt35] Probably there is natural and fast learning directly between neurons, as well as slower learning via the hippocampus. Learning increases with time spent giving attention to the learnable elements, but especially with the number of elements linked to the core element. In repetition it is therefore useful to repeat 'differently' ('elaborative rehearsal', compare elaborate representation!) [#Gall6] Gallwey let his students first watch him hitting 10 forehands, absorb the image, replay it in their minds, and then try it out themselves. [#Grin101] Learning something is easy if it's vital to survival (even for animals) {EW: motivation – children or chimps learning physics?} Though some things are hard/impossible to learn for animals, such as pulling a lever to avoid an electric shock. [#Clar54] Phases: supporting attention (making sure the right data get loaded into working memory), activation of prior knowledge (so the schema's to be built upon are primed for incorporating the new data), management of working memory load, stimulating encoding in LTM (rehearsal, elaborative rehearsal, multimedia helps), and retrieval from long-term memory. Learning can be optimized by 1) optimizing motivational beliefs, 2) activating prior knowledge early in instruction, 3) direct attention to important elements in the lesson, 4) managing irrelevant cognitive load, 5) promoting encoding into LTM, 6) using the job context to promotie retrieval and transfer, 7) build robust mental models, 8) adapting instruction to learners' metacognitive skills. [#Kluw21] Learning may involve multiple areas learning things 'simultaneously', though possibly only on or two are appropriate or effective for the task at hand. [#Kluw103] If you have learned something once, relearning it is faster. This is called so 'savings' method, and can be used to assess learning even though the subject does not consciously recognize the item.[#EW]Gathering knowledge or behaviour (or changing behaviour). Usually learning is done to achieve better results/adaptation in the world, even though it is sometimes used as a testing criterium for general ability (like Imperial China used to do). Learning is performed mainly in schools and universities, for the double reason that children often learn much faster than adults do, and that investing knowledge at the start of someone’s life will give much more dividends than when knowledge is taught later (and because children are not much good for other things?). Learning can be hard because neural connections do not strengthen fast; while this makes sense biologically to prevent humongous overgeneralization and swinging from one behaviour to another each second, it can make learning slow. A second problem in learning is transfer – how well will something learned in an academic environment be applied in the real world? A last problem, though not considered too much, is WHAT should be taught. Should things be taught because they will be useful? May be useful? Or just are beautiful or enjoyable? [#Stol] Good learning is desirable change for both the learners and their organizations/society. Learning works better if it is chunked and organized appropriately to the learner's ability and experience level. [#Stol35] There are three major factors which influence how well we learn: ability, prior knowledge and motivation. [#Ferr271] Learning a language + sport/physical in a foreign country seems the optimal combination. [#Hatt2] Learning requires passion, patience, and attention to detail, from both teacher and learner! [#Hatt163] For successful learning one should have a goal, be motivated to reach that goal, and devise/implement strategies to attain those goals. [#http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/r21270/cv/Nation_2001.htm] For learning a language, direct instruction/learning of the 2000 most common word families is advised, after that it is more efficient to just read text in the domain of interest and learn words that are unknown, until a learner knows 95% of the words, then the rest can usually be inferred. [#Nati35] Learning different things can require different tactics. Word form is best learned through repetitive exposure involving noticing, word meaning by high depth of processing, grammatical collocation implicitly by repetition, constraints on use by explicit guidance and feedback. [#Nati80] Learning by flash-cards can be made more effective by letting learners think of a different context of the chosen word each time they encounter it. [#RoadToExcel36] Since normal performance has only few external observable errors, ambitious practitioners increases their 'errors' by generating internal goals and predictions so their performance can be analyzed with much higher standards than their environment does. [#EW] (Attention + (knowledge)resources + time ) * proper learning strategies = learning [#NRC090511] If there is a danger signal, people become less accurate in differentiating between similar stimuli [perhaps that is why PSSD?] [http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2012/geen-gebarentaal-meer-voor-dove-kinderen-met-implantaat.html?utm_source=120911-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=geen-gebarentaal-meer-voor-dove-kinderen-met-implantaat&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Children with a cochlear implant learn language more quickly if they only learn spoken language, not both spoken language and sign language.

What distinguishes it from related concepts? How does it relate to prior knowledge/experiences {EW: why is it so? Counterexamples? Analogies?}. Recall should be appropriate to the test or situation in which you would use that fact. [#NS020213] Duolingo may help people learn a language. Vesselinov, research. [#Higbee4] Kind of task that you must learn influences how you must memorize (rote, verbatim, application?). What kind of material? For how long? How expert is the learner in the material? Improved study effectiveness and skill do not come easy, but depend on extensive training and practice with study skills and learning strategies. [#13] Memory depends less on how much you have learned than it depends on how you learned it. Use improved methods of recording and retrieving. [#37] Younger adults generally learn faster than older ones (higher rate of learning), but if all people learn to the same degree, forgetting in older and younger people is similar. [#NS250513] Children learn faster – but usually learning is their full-time occupation, and they're continually tested.. Memrise (Ed Cooke) Adult learning may be handicapped since we try to learn 'how' to do it, while it may be better to pay attention to the outcome, to copy what you see. (Gabriele Wulf). Also giving people an ego boost (in the form of a sham test) helps learning quite a bit. [#GeoWissen09] MartinKorte: brain only learns when it is necessary, when there is a meaningful purpose. Just having an hour English in primary school does not work if the child hears and speaks German everywhere. [#Greene55] Choose a place to work where you can learn a lot, not an easy apprenticeship, but one that challenges and toughens you. [<RoumenVesselinov] 34 hours using duolinguo is about as effective as one semester of Spanish. [#EWL] Own observation: Many if not all things you encounter (like the American state capitals) are roughly stored in memory. Storing every letter is therefore overkill; mnemonics should just get you 'close enough' to get to the true target. And for the different states, at least, context information does not help that much, at least it's much less effective than mnemonics, as there is no natural, meaningful link between the properties of a state and its name. Note that loving (liking?) the state may increase attention and thereby memory, like falling in love helps you to remember things about him/her. [#Meeks?] Would writing a book about something help you learn/master the subject?

@Memory: [#Mare/EW] Memory is essential for learning things; however, one can wonder if even techniques like memorizing the American presidents or the digits of pi are very useful, especially since memory fades and needs to be refreshed regularly. Therefore choose carefully what you learn. [#Howe6] The memory of a person is influenced by the things they know and are interested in; experts remember much more of a lecture or such in their field. [#Colv47] Memory is rather domain dependent: it is only exceptionally good for specific tasks you trained it in. [#Wolt12] Our memory was not designed to remember the past, but to react adequately in the present. Partially works automatically when we observe something. Perceptual, semantic and contextual data. Unusual, emotionally positive and important memories are somewhat easier to remember. [#Medi140] It takes more than 10 years before a memory is consolidated and the hippocampus retracts itself. Before that time, the memory is labile. [#EricB51] Memory for reading a text on something is more influenced by expertise on the subject than by verbal IQ scores.[ #EricB225] The vividness of visual memory for (for example) ones breakfast table was not better for eminent scientists {EW, however it may be that meory is domain-specific and specialized, and that scientists would remember papers better than breakfast} [#EricB546] Some people seem (naturally?) better at retention over longer time periods than others, but it is not clear how big the effect is and whether it is the tail of a natural distribution of an ability. Working memory size does not seem too relevant. Motivation may be... [#CIAch3] Memory does not depend very much on repetition or how long information is kept in STM. Memory depends mostly on associations; which depend on links made to existing schemata, as well as the level of processing. The latter is amount of effort, as well as the number and strength of associations (story>visual image>rhyme>#letters). How well something is remembered depends on what was stored first (first impressions), how credible the information is, how much attention was spent on it at first, and how important it seemed. Memories are accessed preferentially if they were more recent, more vivid, had a greater impact on ones welfare, and many other factors. [#Kluw52] Memory is affected by emotional states, but: emotional states must not be too strong, else they inhibit the ability to remember, the reinforcing effect is only suitable for medium-length recall (>2 minutes), positive contents are usually better remembered than negative contents; fear and depression may block memory formation; emotional states affect the contents of the episodic/autobiographical memory more than factual knowledge; in complex scenarios, emotions seem (but debated!) to promote the memory of core events rather than of peripherals. [#Kluw74] The memory traces may be the same neurons/synapses who processed the original input! So memory may just be the motor/sensory resonance. {does this explain expertise?} Same pattern is engraved over many repetitions (so changing contexts are discarded; the essence remains} {EW: would that also explain why people see what they expect to see, perhaps even GABA inhibiting alternative explanations?} [#Bran] The first and last things of a lesson are remembered best. [#Kluw160] Memories are not 'static', they are slowly modified as they are recalled and compared to other memories/knowledge. Perhaps this consolidation/modification also takes place during sleep/dreaming. [#Kluw180] Memory disorders may involve forgetting things after 30-120 minutes, or after 40 days! So.. quite a lot of things can apparently go wrong, memory seems much more vulnerable than intelligence. [#Kluw182] Next to search, the prefrontal cortex also does monitoring/checking to see whether the retrieved memories are the correct ones. [Boekaerts27] Memory basically saves information in an abstract way, words and pictures are 'reconstructed' when the memory is fetched again {EW: similar to the abstractness and pre-verbalness of an idea} [#Foer27] We have a great memory for pictures, what we have seen versus what we haven't seen; even if things differ in only one tiny detail. [#Foer29] The Wagenaar experiments would suggest we lose instead of forgetting things, however, memories seem to be actively reconstructed, so some alteration may take place {EW: is uniqueness key?} Penfield's experiments (stimulating the brain at a certain spot) may just have incited hallucinations. [#NRC301010] This is because simultaneous activation hippocampus gave hallucinations and fantasies the feeling of being memories. [#Foer31] None of the talmudist-memorizers attained any degree of prominence in the scholarly world. Mental athletes convert ideas into images, and put them along a route, very similar to what S. did, only trained {because of ancestral evolved memory; what we needed in the past}. [#Foer84] Infants learn a lot, but mostly 'subconscious' – autobiography is yet poorly developed, due to lack of framework to make sense of the data and store it so you can retrieve it later. [#Foer91] New memories should be exciting, colourful, unique. [#Foer94] Simonides' technique of the dinnertable could equally easily be used for Greek dramatists ordered by date of birth. [#Foer99] Multisensorily seems to be important {EW: and meaning?liking? Anything else that invites memory [speech books? SUCCES?] Fuinnier, lewder, more bizarre? Shocking, dishonorable? Images of virgins?} Animate images as well. {EW: and persons?} And more mental work also makes something more memorable. [#Foer108] Memorizing can also be exhausting {EW: probably if you need to exert lots of willpower to pay attention to things] [#Foer128] Best remembered: repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, easily visualized. Song helps! The Odyssey seems mnemonic as the less-memorable pieces have 'evolved away' [#Foer133] Some people (girls) try to use emotion instead of visualisation to remember text verbatim {EW: neat trick? Or may be just an alternative if emotions stir more of your brain than visualisation?} [#NS03122011] While retrieving a memory, we also re-encode it, so being fed false information at that time can modify the memory. [#Will53] If you think about something carefully, you'll probably need it again; memory is not what you try to remember, but what you think about. [#Will58] Emotion enhances memory above the 'elaborate representation by talking about it a lot, but the emotion needs to be quite strong to have a noticeable effect; not practical for school learning. Emotional things will be better remembered, but emotion is not necessary for learning.If you focus your thoughts on something on school, it should generally focus not on what things look or sound like, but their meaning, especially the right aspect of meaning. [#NS06102012] Children don't tend to remember an event until they have learned the words to describe it. May be that memory is just a way to ciollect data to construct imagination of possible futures, and that memories can get mixed up in the process. [#NS020213] Memories appear first in your dreams the night after the event, and then again 5 to 7 days later (consolidation?). However, memories are not stored as wholes, rather as fragments; memories are broken down and repackaged during consolidation. [#Foer23] S's memories never degraded {EW: due to uniqueness? Inability to form links with other neurons?} [#29] Wagenaar found that not one of his memories had actually been forgotten; the problem seemed to be retrieval {EW: but could be reconstruction due to all the prodding of others?}. Penfield's experiments with neuronal stimulation seem to have been hallucinations. Shass Pollak never attained any prominence in scholarly world, despite knowing the Talmud by heart. Baker/baker paradox: easier to remember that someone is a baker than that someone is called 'Baker' [#Foer62] The number-rememberer made a meaning out of random input, so running times [EW: association / emotion / importance?] Meaning made the information much stickier. [#Foer77] If you do the same things day in day out, days blend into each other. Going on exotic vacations, changing the routine, stretches out psychological time and lengthens our perception of our lives. Not all memories are conscious: even EP could read words faster if he had already seen them before; so there may be different mechanisms at work for conscious versus unconscious memories [EW: but may be merely reactivated memory traces, no long-term remembering? Still, the neighbours...]. Children may not remember their early years well, may be part anatomy, part lack of schema's to link memories together and make them accessible, part lacking language. Value judgements (like Eps) are often independent of declarative memory. [#91] Our early ancestors did need to remember was where to find food and resources, and the route home, and which plants were edible and which were poisonous. General idea of most memory techniques is to use something boring and change it into somethingthat is so colorful, so exciting, so different from anything you've ever seen that you can't forget it. Simonides realized spatial memory would have worked for concepts as well as it had for guests. Remember multisensorily: the more hooks information has, the greater the chance that it is remembered. Attention is not something that you can simply will, it has to be pulled in by the details (vivid etc). The funnier, lewder, the more bizarre, the better. [#101] Animate images {EW: and persons?} seem to be more memorable than inanimate images. Perhaps partially since it requires more mental processing. Note: visualizing/memorizing seems to make you tired {EW: too much stress/exertion?} [#124] We don't remember text verbatim, since the essence of what is said is the topic, the exact words are just window dressing. The structure of the Illias and Odyssey can best be understood as one big mnemonic. Brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and easily visualized. Words that rhyme are more easy to remember than words that don't; concrete nouns easier than abstract nouns, dynamic images are more memorable than static images, alliteration aids memory. And song is especially useful as well! Oral poetry is kind of evolution: hardest parts are forgotten. [#193] Memorization is not a very transferable skill, which pulled the rug from under the 19th century curriculum. (EW: but did not impact its practice much) [#Foer206] Students summarizing by mind-mapping retained 10% more factual knowledge than those using ordinary summaries (look up reference!) Foer thinks that most of the benefit comes from needing to be more alert than with regular note taking, so more attention paid. Without prior knowledge, you don't have the pegs to effectively learn (like Foer wandered through Shanghai) Like listeners can't process what's important and unimportant, bad processing of information taken in. Memory is like a spiderweb, the bigger it grows, the more it captures. And the more it captures, the bigger it grows... [#Foer268] Being mindful may be the most important basis of memory. [#Draaisma27] Children have memory; they know whom they like and dislike, but can't remember it later [EW: implicit memory, not yet really semantic in words; that may be the problem with verbal memorizations, putting them somewhere they can be retrieved. Verbal thoughts may be the core of many depressive illnesses but also of memory, especially since the cue is usually a word [or a smell]] [#Higbee22] Can be procedural, semantic or episodic (personal events). [#27] Correct recognition score is about 90% for words, 88% for sentences, and 98% for pictures. Elderly adults don't perform as well as young do in free-recall tasks, but they do as well on recognition and cued-recall tasks. [#Higbee49] Enhanced by familiarity, rhymes and patterns. Organisation: different organisations help for different tasks. Categories help memorization, even if people are only told about possible categories {EW: extra/dual representation? Automatic abstraction activated?} Instructing people to organize the material works as well as instructing people to learn the material (for learning). Use serial positioning effect to either move the complex/less meaningful items to the end of the list, or spend more time on the middle. Association is also really helpful. The more associations, the more meaningful; good teachers help students associate facts with more things that they know. Increase recall of classmates by imagining various situations of high school. Imagery also helps a lot! Finally, attention is important. If we are distracted: problems! Attention spent on learning tasks correlates more highly to school achievement than time spent on task! [#Draaisma32] Memories of children are often not accessible; if they don't know the word for 'handle', handle is not remembered/recalled. Also a problem with early memories is that children often live in scripts or routines, which makes memories blur, so nothing is distinctive enough to remember. [#Sommers223] While our memories for the good deeds of ingroup members and outgroup members are about the same (70%), we forget misdeeds of ingroup members much more than those of outgroup members (memorization 57% vs 82%); we forgive (and forget) ingroup members more easily, and hold outsiders to higher, less attainable standards. [#Higbee70] Memory problems in the elderly may for a part be related to their greater interest in the past than in the present or the future (notice what 70-year-olds talk about). [#Adams89] Memory formation influenced by importance, unexpectedness and ease of encoding (telephone dial) [#NS010214ChildhoodAmnesia] The memories that children have of the first 3 years of age start to fade away when children reach 7. [#Paul22] Ideas are remembered best if they have one anomalous feature, most other features being normal or prototypical. [#NS020917HowYouFileAwayYourMemories] Memories are ‘replayed’ during sleep in the hippocampus, what is poorly remembered at first is replayed more, and more replays lead to better retention. [#NS071017HowOurSleepingBrainStoresAwayMemories] When sleeping, patterns of brain activity (corresponding to the new activity that was learned) first replayed, when the subjects entered non-REM sleep, the pattern started to fade from the cortex, but a similar activity started in the putamen, possibly to keep the cortex capable of storing fresh memories.

@Motivation: [#EW] The most important factor in excellence is motivation, however it is unclear what causes motivation. A contrast between current circumstances and desired circumstances (Curacao boys and their role model baseball player), meaning the value/desirability of the reward, the chance one gives oneself to get the reward (self-efficacy) will both affect the motivation positively. It may be that this is, by the way, more important for music or sports than it is for science which does not have huge rewards. The inner resilience (influenced by depression and such) may also have to do with whether the goal is achieved. {EW: perhaps scientists motivated by uncertainty over universe instead of glory and fame?} If all exercise was pleasant, genius wouldn't be so rare. Motivation also requires eye for detail, for only then can one see small progress which may not be noticed (and therefore discourage) others. {EW: famous scientists appear to be 'lazy' – they mainly work hard when motivated, rather than out of principle. Working hard on something you don't like may therefore not be a good way to become a great scientist. It might also explain why scientists would indeed tend to grow duller the longer they need to do 'supervised' research; mainly the hard workers instead of the inspired ones prosper} [#EW] Doing a 'forced march' of having to do far too much unpleasant work for an uncomfortable deadline (diminishing time for relaxation and fun) tends to kill motivation. [#EW] Motivation can be by being in tribe, extrinsic ? intrinsic through time, or exploring options, or the ice-cream method (study your job/area) ?Would extraversion (increases in reward sensitivity) be related to motivation? Or is extraversion more subtle (arousal may differ from reward-sensitivity?) [#EW] Being motivated to do something does NOT mean that doing it is much fun (such as buying suits for a job interview). Motivation merely determines what you will do, not whether the action itself will be rewarding; just that the expected/possible outcome may be. Reward motivation versus habit motivation versus punishment motivation. Motivation for something may always be in competition with the motivation for other activities. [#Clar338] Motivation predicts about 50% of the variance in achievement {in learning?} [#StolB45] Motivation is made up of assigned value, confidence to perform well, and mood. [#Csik97] Talented teenagers are more motivated in reading and thinking (classwork and studying was not different from normal teens), and slightly positively motivated when alone (compared to big negative motivation for untalented teenagers) [#VU] Motivations: status, social belonging (belonging to a group), imitating people of higher status (role models giving good example) [#Video] Mastery, purpose, autonom. [#Pers40] Talent/intelligence seems much more important for achievement than motivation, though its much harder to accurately measure motivation than it is to measure intelligence.<EW: talent is problematic to measure in itself> [#Tigg73] Reminding oneself of one's own achievements can work more inspiring than telling about the achievements of others (say, Bill Gates). [#Burn286] Third of seven depression sensitivity areas – does your self-esteem depend on how successful you are? [#Stol37] The third important factor in learning (next to prior knowledge and ability). Motivation depends on three factors: value, confidence and mood. EW: Note that ultra-high motivation can be detrimental in learning complex skills. [#Pers370] Motivation seems to generally have large individual differences – some people like to eat or read much more than others, or avoid situations others would welcome. [#Whit25] Only truly effective motivation is self-motivation. There are different types: motivation for the opportunity for real responsibility and choice, the build self-esteem and identity, and to make a real contribution. [#Burn125] Note that often motivation follows action, not the other way around. [#Scho100] Motivation can be because of lack (diminish tension) or because of striving for more tension or satisfaction. [#Nels97] The more motivated students, the more time they spend on a project and the better they become. [#Hatt48] Motivation is highest when students are competent, have sufficient autonomy, set worthwhile goals, get feedback, and are affirmed by others. [#Syed107] If the motivation is internal, it does not matter whether the book is boring. [#Bron173] Motivation releases dopamine, which makes the brain learn more. Motivation is enhanced by having a choice. [#HeaB28] Sometimes you don't need motivation, but direction. [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368_supp/full/478S2a.html] Any (deep?) need can drive or jumpstart motivation, even competition, like in Nobelprizewinner Steitz “The oldest of five children, Steitz has admitted to being an average student in high school, until motivated to compete against his youngest brother who was getting better grades” [#Franzen14] The essence of motivation is choice, what choices one makes. [#DeMoor24] Reasons to work is not only money; it's to combat loneliness, to do something meaningful, and to achieve something. [#DeMoor29] There are quite some things that are motivating, like autonomy, input, skill, responsibility, variety, and interacting with others, but not all employees weigh all aspects as heavily. Also, motivational priorities change over one's lifetime. Don't try to treat all employees as equal. [#DeMoor50] The relevant factors are the person's judgements on the value of the rewards, and their self-efficacy (how likely they consider it to get those rewards). [#DeMoor116] What gives feedback often also gives motivation. {EW: working with people = more feedback = more motivation? And learning?} Far goals may diminish motivation relative to competing close goals. [#Drive8] no reward-reward-no-reward leads to more persistence when rewarded but lower persistence afterwards. [#Steel136] Motivation may increase with increasing challenge, but perhaps that is because the brain decides to invest more effort in it because that seems necessary. [#Steel164] Actions that don't fit self-determined and self-defined goals are amotivational. So find larger, resonating goals and attach your current goals to them. Or at the very least see something as a willpower training. [#Franzen14] The essence of motivation are the choices you make. [#Franzen16] Many experts think that people are led by striving towards an 'ideal self'. [#EW27012012] Do motivational theories neglect cost of achieving something, either time/effort or opportunity cost? [#EW03082012] Does clarity of purpose enhance motivation or just decrease distracting fear/uncertainty? [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2012/zelf-concrete-doelen-stellen-helpt-hartproblemen-voorkomen.html?utm_source=120925-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=zelf-concrete-doelen-stellen-helpt-hartproblemen-voorkomen&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] A motivation card (picture WHY you want to make those lifestyle changes) and regular feedback on how goals are achieved (step-counter etc.) help prevent new heart disease. Especially when partner gets involved in support. [#PsychMagjul/aug2004] Students that are mainlyinterested in wealth and fame get lower grades than students with more altruistic life goals (society/relationships). [#Davidson14] Motivation may neurologically originate in the hypothalamus. [#NS180513] Taste preferences can have to do with genes, but not mainly mutations in taste or smell genes, but also in genes modifying the pleasure/reward pathways. So, part of motivation (at least for food) is genetically predisposed? [#VincentHuijts] In the first phase, you may get motivated by rewards, especially small ones, or socially extrinsic ones. In later phases, being challenged in a positive way [so no big punishment for failure] works, especially when you get feedback. Feeling competent is important [EW: may depend on fixed or growth mindset] Authority vs authoritarianness. Emotional engagement helps learning.[EW: through attention? Or as indicator of value?] [#NS010214] Since hunger is no longer a problem in developed countries, what can make people eat more? Food pleasure. And what creates food pleasure? Sugar. [#Renwick02] When students are interested in an activity and feel free to choose whether to do it or not, they are more likely to engage in higher-level cognitive functioning. [#Renwick177] Clarissa at first preferred easier pieces; motivation was intrinsic not in being 'mastery motivation' but enjoyment of the sound (and control?) [#NS230612ThinkPositiveToEncourageGreenLiving] Climate sceptics are more likely to endorse climate mitigation action if they are told it would help social cohesion or technological progress. [#CoyleT3] Motivation starts with brief, powerful encounters that link your identity to a high-performing person or group. “I could be them” [#http://www.pnas.org/content/111/30/10990.abstract] Having extrinsic motives next to intrinsic motives indeed saps motivation (in any case in West Point) and results in fewer promotions and such. [#BenKuikenDePRETFactor] Positive environment (people like each other and can make jokes with one another), Respect (autonomy - you decide how you do your job) Enthusiasm (a motivating goal, not 'make 20% more profit) Teamwork (organisation not hierarchical) [#McGon73] Students being told that doing their best would help find a cure for Alzheimer's disease also have higher self-control. As does hearing that practice will improve performance on a difficult task. [#Hooked63] Fogg distinguishes three axes of motivation: pleasure/pain, hope/fear and social acceptance/rejection. [#Hooked97] What draws us is not reward, but the need to alleviate the craving for it. [#Burkem69] Who says you need to be motivated before you can act? You can also start (rituals). “Inspiration is for amateurs, the rest of us just show up and get to work. Alternative: learn to . [#EW] Perhaps 3: biological motivation (possibly strengthened by Krekels factors), Pink motivation (drive), and social motivation (extrinsic social motivation, role models, emphasis of society, ‘yes I can’) [#Making it in academic psychology: Demographic and personality correlates of attainment] Mastery and work needs were correlated positively with citation, competition motivation negatively. [#Markus6] East asian children solve more puzzles if they think their mother has chosen them for them, American children solve most puzzles if they can choose them themselves, and least when they think their mom has chosen them [7 to 9 year olds; what about adults?]

@Personality: [#Eyse63] The successful men in Terman's study were less moody, impulsive and conformist, more self-confidence, sociability, perserverance, integration towards goals, absence of inferiority feelings, and more common sense. [#Bloo473] The parents of talented children occasionally though that another child of theirs had more 'natural ability', but the future high achiever had more persistence, competiveness, eagerness, willingness to work hard and desire to excel {EW: at least in sports/music families?}. [#EricB157] The Big Five are not consistently related for job success – you probably prefer different personalities for different jobs. [#EricB291] For scientists, seems to be curiosity, need for independence, autonomy, personal mastery of the environment. [#Pers50] A person's personality is remarkably consistent over time. We are usually much more impressed with how we have changed over time than that others are. [#Hatt45] Personality does not greatly influence academic achievement, though a small positive effect for openness, and a r=0.44 for conscientousness. [#Nett9] Personality can be fractal-like, with big patterns of behaviour being repeated in small patterns. While personality is a bad predictor of behaviour on one particular occasion, it shows quite some effects since the tendency is multiplied by the thousands of situations an individual is put into. [#EW] Is personality big 5 + values + beliefs (+ identity? Or is that beliefs about oneself?] [#Franzen285] Personality may also be shaped by the role that someone takes up in the peer group, and is acknowledged in [EW: but would that still be valid outside the peer group? See elder children-phenomenon] [#TheodoorHolman] A 'Personality' needs to have a big memory, and needs to make quick decisions (quality doesn't matter too much, speed does), and be able to think fast half-logically and half creatively. [besides: don't worry about decisions; the consequences are relatively small and easy to remedy] [#Hargit57] Strong personalities (read: big ego's) are rather common in Nobel Laureates. [#Hargit69] John Bardeen and Lawrence Bragg were however very modest, Bardeen's golf partner never knowing that Bardeen had won two Nobel prizes. Though humility is not always seen as conductive to the advancement of learning. Stubbornness and perseverance help. Toughness, drive and determination [EW: but not the wave?] [#Hargit106] Cram had built himself in the image of several people he admired in his readings, and also it was important which people he did not want to resemble. [#Nass67] People with different personalities see the world in very different ways, making it hard to understand each other's point of view [EW: me and Claire?] [#Nass72] We prefer people with a clear personality, everyone dislikes ambiguous personalities. We like people less if they are described with conflicting adjectives; body posture and speech must match. Effect trumps similarity-attraction. [#NS051013 Careful what you say] http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebDocs/personality-poster_SK.pdf Personality can be deduced from the essays that you write. [#NS280913] Having a different mood can make some people feel as if they have a different personality. [Solving the puzzle of why Finns have the highest IQ, but one of the lowest number of Nobel prizes in Europe] Finns may not win Nobel prizes as they on average have high conscientiousness and agreeableness, but low extraversion and psychoticism.[#NS220417YourTrueSelf] Personality can change if you go live in another city (Londoners are less Agreeable), change a job, get a divorce (divorced women become more extroverted and open), unemployment makes people less agreeable and conscientious. Little correlation between personality at 14 and at 77 [#HaidtH142] Personality may have multiple levels; next to big 5, there is a level of ‘characteristic adaptations’ (personal goals, defense and coping mechanisms, values, beliefs, and life-stage concerns) [#EW and learned rewards/threats?], and the “life story”

@Research: [#Influencexii] Research can be done (especially in social sciences) by experiments, interviews with 'compliance professionals' and their opponents, books and manuals of the field, and participant observation (being trained as a salesperson) [#NS121013p48] Academic and market research can appear desultory by comparison [to government/war research] as the efforts of the former are divided into ever more specialized problems, and those of the latter are expended in chasing fickle customers. [#Catmul197] You must do research. Research trips, many observations, make film better, avoid clichés [EW: and for science?]

@Thinking: [#Watt24] Thinking and reasoning are necessary to acquire any skill. {ehm... and rote learning and learning movements/procedures like dancing? Though adaptive expertise may require thinking indeed}[#Csik136] About 20% of time spent at a talent-activity is spent thinking about extrinsic rewards in the domain, other people in the domain, or themselves.[#EW] Thinking is only applied when something unexpected happens, or you are not effective in achieving a goal. Without goals or ambition or desire, thinking does not happen a lot (and if it happens, it's mostly 'brain noise'. [#Hatt27] If students are not doing enough thinking, there is something wrong with the instruction (Sherpa metaphor). [#EW] Would making people think (surprise, odd thing) make them more anxious/discomfortable, just like anxiety/discomfort cause thinking? Or are people naturally uncomfortable in weird situations {would be logical} [#Davidson10] Even imaginary (virtual) practice can make regions in the motor cortex (for playing piano, for example) grow. [#JaapBrouwer130213] Meer denken: wat doe je d, hoe doe je het dan, is dit wel de beste manier? [#Greene101] At a certain point, Faraday was able to 'think like Davy'. (or have internalized the same questions Davy always asked himself?) [#301] Everett started thinking like a Piranha. [#NS110114] Thinking may not be the 'default setting' of the human mind, as Socrates criticized his contemporaries for their unthinking pursuit of power and pleasure. [#MartenSchefferTheForgottenHalf] EW: I disagree with Scheffer that there is 'systematic' thinking – there are habits and procedures, making some thoughts 'obvious' after another thought, but it's more like a random chance process. [#Catmul312] Steve’s demands of specificity could clarify Ed’s thinking. [#HayesS56] We are always thinking, and most of our thoughts go unnoticed.

@Training: [#Schm207] Training should focus on long-term performance and transfer, even if the accompanying training methods hurt short-term skill acquisition. [#StolB11] Training only works when lack of performance is caused by lack of knowledge or skill.[#HoweX408] With training, all subjects improve, but a difference between the best and worst remains and can even get larger, correlating more with intelligence than in the beginning![#EricsKramp370] A number of training studies in real life have compared the efficiency of practice durations ranging from 1 -8 hr per day. These studies show essentially no benefit from durations exceeding 4 hr per day and reduced benefits from practice exceeding 2 hr. [#Greene76] Cesar Rodriguez found out that through strenuous practice he could overcome his fear and any lack of skill – especially by placing him in critical yet difficult situations (in a training context) again and again and again. In the end, however, he had the feeling that he could fly the plane at the edge of his fingertips. [#Greene80] Our skills often become lopsided as we avoid our weaknesses. Resist the temptation to be nice to yourself; become your own worst critic, see your work as through the eyes of others. [#Flourish83] Training effects greater with more training and closer supervision by coaches in work. [#CoyleT104] You can learn a lot by training the skill in others / less advanced learners. Also. A new skill needs to be built for at least eight weeks [EW:?] [#SutheA9] “Train every animal as if it’s a killer whale” (that you can neither forcibly move it or dominate it”, “it’s never the animal’s fault.”. Principles: 1) ignore the behavior you don’t want. 2) any interaction is training [Animal Training, Ken Ramirez] 3) [EW] Animals also like to master their environment, any reaction they can reliably get is fun (even if person is screaming) 4) being trained/learning gives mental stimulation [which is handy for bored animals in a zoo or something] 5) “If something does not work, try to think of something else.” 6) animals aren’t people; most don’t like to be touched, for example. 7) sometimes one should not train, for example when an animal is stressed or doesn’t perceive well (hot winds, or molting), or when you yourself are not feeling well. 8) Know your species (group animal? Predator?) 9) know your individual (individual animals have different ages/genders/life histories, handicaps). Some things can be taight easily, others are harder. What constitues reward (and even punishment) depends on the animal [not on the trainer… 10) behaviors that are instinctive [have been there for a very long time] or from a fundamental trait may be too hard to change to be worth training. Also beware (with people) if they are not aware of their habits. 11) desentisizing/habituating can work. Note it also works for (or rather, against) punishment 12) or counterconditioning: making an animal used to something that is naturally unnerving, by coupling it to something good 13) punishment is very inaccurate, at least humans will try all kinds of tricks to avoid it or are simply desentisized. Note that it can work in some cases: if it is immediate, measured, and stops when the behaviour stops. Still, always has negative things like desensitivize, decrease trust account, and have nasty side effects [note that animals and people use punishment also to show who is boss, which dogs may accept but most other animals don’t] 13) Also note that positive reinforcement builds trust. 14) only ignore behaviour if nobody or nothing is to get hurt. 14) reinforce/thank every bit of good behaviour. Positive reinforcement must be timely (now!), so animal trainers use whistles or clickers if getting the reward out would take too long. Practice new behaviors at various locations. Superstitious behaviors: when the trainer is too late with the reinforcement, or when the trainer accidentally gives too many cues. Don’t reinforce trying, but doing (or at least setting steps). Use the smallest bit of reinforcement that does the job. Both for practical purposes: you don’t want the animal to be full too soon (food reward) or spend much time chewing. Still needs to be better than the reward for alternative behaviors. Jackpot for big breakthrough or to raise from apathy. Variability of rewards (best reward also depends on mood or age of animal). Variable schedules (for reinforcement). Baby steps/successive approximations [we cannot change totally and quickly ourselves, think of the new years resolutions]. When a behavior deteriorates, go back to kindergarten (a simpler stage). Only train one aspect at the same time, so really ‘successive approximations’. Too many things would confuse the animal. Also, don’t raise the bar mid-behavior. “New tank syndrome” - one needs to redo training (a bit) if the animal is in a new environment. Try something different – if one method does not work, try another! Luring: problematic, the reward needs to be big enough, and the lure may incite the bad behavior in the first place. Least reinforcing scenario: don’t show any reaction whatsoever. Also shows the animal that it is not bad to mess up. However, does not help if the behavior is self-reinforcing and is unwise if the behavior is dangerous. LRS not the same as timeout (when the trainer leaves or stops the training, which can be considered either a reward or as a punishment). LRS hard since humans have an urge to respond. Behavior will be lost if not reinforced with some frequency [EW: unless it becomes habitual? Still, old habits may run deeper] Seek incompatible behaviors (hard to do the undesired behavior at the same time as the new behavior, like landing on a rug instead of on the trainer’s head). Note that you can use ‘incompatible behaviors’ with people, though the author refers more to bringing people into ‘incompatible situations’. Contrast with non-violent-communication. Also important to watch for antecedents, that a situation or emotion has the potential to worsen; cut it off as soon as possible before the emotions flood the animal. Or displace the aggression. Check for the scenarios the individual animal goes through, or early signs. Note that playtime is important too!

@Work: [#Pau] Hard work is needed for any measure of success. [#Howe] Geniuses work with commitment, ferocity and intensity. Newton was not discouraged when he struggled with Descartes' Geometry. [#VU] Work is good for psychic health, IF you have large amounts of control, and preferably also good social support (nice colleagues/boss) [#Fran117] Men are most content when doing some {productive?} work. [#Hobbelt] People don't work for money, but for meaning and for social contacts {EW: they do say differently}. [#Frank_van_Luijk] Making money seems to be becoming the primary reason to go to work, displacing contributing to society, nice contacts, or getting acknowledgements. Simultaneously, paid work is becoming less central in life, people trying to do the important things as hobbies. [#NS250616IWorkThereforeIAm] Work also gives people a sense of identity – 55% on average gets some sense of identity from their jobs, 70% of college graduates. Though in medieval Europe, sense of belonging more family, religion, or place we lived. [#NS250616FutureOfWork] Work only became end in itself and source of identity with rise of paid employment in 19th century.  [#HaidtH211] People get most often unhappy in jobs with low complexity and much routine, happier if having latitude in approaching work that is varied and challenging. People see work as job, career or calling. May be best to try practice your strength at work. Field is healthy as long as doing good (producing value) is aligned with doing well (being rewarded). [#Leber69] Paid work is negatively correlated to happiness, and ranks lower than any other activity except lying sick in bed. [#Bregma49] Half of professionals has ‘bullshit jobs’ that do not provide meaning; however, unemployment has a bigger effect on wellbeing than a divorce or a loss of a loved one.

] 10-20 minutes relaxation (reciting words, breathing exercises, emptying the mind) prevents telomer breakdown, improves cellular efficiency, ups insulin production, and decreases acivity of genes involved in chronic inflammation. [#KLM_airplane_programme]: feel body contacts, feel warmth within, focus on solar plexus.

^Games: [#Sidis] Boris Sidis didn't believe that children playing games were spending their time well when they could be gaining knowledge. He believed, as a parent, in directing the child's energies. [#EW/WoW] Games may simplify things (like making a ' tasty cupcake' in WoW from an egg, flour and fire), which may be training parts, or a template to fit in the whole; more adult people usually want more realistic games(?) [#CoyleT100] Games slow progress, since a) the presence of other people diminishes your appetite for risk, nudging you away from your sweet spot, b) reduce the number of quality reps, c) encourages shortcuts instead of working on technique, d) encourages people to judge by the scoreboard instead of by how much was learned. 5:1 practice to competition or 10:1 practice to competition is better, and at Spartak pupils are forbidden from entering any competition the first three years.

^Practice: [#EW] Practice doesn't make perfect, as most people stop improving when they have reached a (for them) acceptable level of performance. Carefully measuring performance and experimenting with different techniques (and enough time investment!) are needed to continue improving. Some practice is also needed to stay at a certain level. [#EricB53] Practice reduces cognitive demands needed for a task, freeing up cognitive reserves for planning and monitoring. [#More94] Varying practice, especially going for some 'small, easy victories' may help overcome decreasing motivation. [#Syed91] Practice needs be difficult/challenging to have most effect. [#EricsD432] Practice makes permanent, not perfect. [#CoyleT39] Many people see practice as necessary drudgery – in the talent hotbeds, practice is the big game. <comfort zone: not reaching or struggling, 80% or more success rate> Sweet spot: frustration, difficulty, altertness to errors. Survival zone: feels desperate, like guessing: 50% or less. If you tried your absolute hardest, what could you almost do? Also: take off your watch, and count reaches and reps: not minutes of practice, but effort. For the rest – find the smallest chunks, and try to perfect one thing each day. Embrace struggle! Turn drills into games (if it can be counted...) Preferably practice alone. Pay attention to your mistakes, and ask yourself what you can do to improve. Take mistakes seriously, but never personally. Visualize the wires of your brain making new connections (if you make mistakes). Visualize them getting faster, from copper wire to broadband. Shrink the space in which you practice (Toyota uses toy-sized models to train, or look at futsal). Slow the practice down – it't not about how fast you can do it, it is about how slow you can do it correctly (taijiquan?). Close your eyes. Mime it (do the essentials – you can swing a golf club without using a ball). When you get it right, pay attention to how you did it – that is the real start of practice. Napping helps too. Exaggerate a new move when learning it. Positive framing: think about what you want to do instead of what you want to avoid. Sandwich technique: make right move, then wrong move, so you can detect the difference, then the right move again. 3X10 technique. Practice something three times with ten minutes between each repetition. Invent daily tests and games. Small motivation (money, or chocolate, or pride) as prize [may work if lack of focus]. Test: what is one key element of this skill? How can I increase my accuracy or reliabilty, and measure it? How can I make it fun, quick and repeatable so I can track my progress? REPS: reaching and repeating (stretch ability), Engagement (command attention), Purposefulness (relevant to skill), Strong, Speedy feedback [though for complex skills?]. Stop before you are exhausted – errors creep in. Practice immediately after performance (so when the mistakes are still freshest in your mind). Just before sleep, watch a mental movie of your idealized performance. End on a positive note, with some small reward. Embrace repetition. Have a blue-collar mindset – go do it whether you like it or not [but for scientists???]

A, not B-error: [#Kluw210] Infants reaching for a toy at the place it was previously – perhaps through lack of inhibition, or because the pathway has been learned and rewarded?

ABC: [#Pers117] Antecedents, Behaviour, Consequences. To change our behaviour, we usually either need to change the antecedents or the consequences. [#Tigg130] Pleasant consequences will increase the frequency of a certain behaviour. The stimuli immediately before and after a behaviour will have the strongest impact. Immediately and with certainty make this effect even greater!

Ability: [#RoadToEx28] Individual differences in inherent capacities and abilities are surprisingly poor predictors for expert performance. [#Foer63] Chess grandmasters don't seem to have any cognitive advantage over average people. (Rssian 1920s research)

Absorption: [#EricB159] A personality trait in how much someone can become absorbed in something (like I had when reading like a child, in class, or later with WoW and other computer games).

Abstracting: [#Root03] Abstracting is the third thinking tool. It is focusing on a single property of a thing or process in order to simplify it and grasp its essence.

Abstraction: [#Watt165] Abstraction is a great good, but only after a good introduction with concreteness to anchor it. [#EricB281] Brains can naturally abstract (interpret 'four' as 4), but this step can be skipped as learning starts to create direct connections between stimulus neuron and response neuron. (becoming stronger/faster than the triangle-link). [#EricB367] More experienced pilots have more abstract strategies, which gives them more flexible plans{EW: more working memory available to see the wood from the trees?}. [#Ster198] Abstracting a problem is more likely to give more creative solutions as people get less in the rut of familiar patterns. [#Will88] You can best teach abstraction by using lots of different concrete examples. Though actually it is not the concreteness, but the familiarity that is important; new knowledge needs to be anchored in familiar things. [#EW] Would the abstraction that Einstein was forced to practice as a patent examiner (what are the similarities and differences between two technologies?) make him more creative? [#Evans181] We couple abstract things to concrete things – intelligence is embedded. So love is a journey.

Abstraction-jump: [#EW140713] Like Raman reasoned that if X-rays were scattered by matter, that it may be a property of electromagnetic-waves in general – so tested for light.

Academic development: [#Parr15] Should perhaps a student take extra time to participate in social activities to become a 'leader'? Poor students may not have the time or means to do so.

Academic education: [#Howe34] Though the knowledge transferred through academic education is mostly useless, it encourages the development of skills such as a habit of studying, self-confidence that one can learn things, the value of studying. {would it also entail a change in attitude?}

Academic success: [#Hatt42] Academic success is not correlated with social skill. [EW: but perhaps success in the real world is!] [#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory] Academic success is more strongly related to working memory capacity at age 5 than to IQ.

Acceptance: [#HayesS7] Trying to get rid of your pain only amplifies it. [#47] Acceptance helps physical pain managfement anxiety, substance abuse, depression and job performance.

Acclaim: [#Colv193] Acclaim and attention can be encouraging/motivating practice.

Accountability: [#Geowissen09] Canadese schools produce better results than German students, even if they are more autonomous. However, they have to justify themselves and students have to take national tests, which seems to be a necessary component for success.

Acetylcholine: [#Kluw150] Acetylcholine seems to be important in memory formation, as its precursors enhance memory, antagonists are amnesic. Or, possibly, it affects motivational changes which seem to have some influence on behaviour which may be misattributed to a pure memory effect (but a memory effect seems yet the most likely explanation).

Achievement: [#EWL] In KIPP-schools, students have to 'earn' everything, including their desks! Perhaps this functions as feedback and as idea that they have had successes and are in control of their lives. [#Bloo440] Many of the parents Bloom investigated set high standards, were sometimes even perfectionistic. “Being busy” was not enough, you had to do things well. [#Hatt47] Achievement enhanced by students having learning rather than performance strategies, accept rather than discount feedback, benchmark to difficult rather than easy goals, compare themselves to subject criteria rather than to other students, possess high rather than low efficacy to learning, and effect self-regulation and personal control rather than learned helplessness. Generally, such questions/self-strategies should be addressed before one tries to enhance achievement. [#AnitaDeVries] Conscientousness and integrity [not striving for status or material possessions] most important for study success; you need a minimum of IQ, but above that other things. On labour market: conscientousness, emotional stability, eye for detail, flexible, show initiative and self-assured. [#McPhersonCommitment] Children's beliefs about their personal competence and valuing an activity predict how much effort they will exert on a task, their subsequent performance and feeling of self-worth. Self-concept, ability perceptions and expectations for success effective predictors for achievement. Parental involvement key element in children's willingness to sustain and persist with regular practice. Successful learners exert more effort and are more cognitively engaged duing their practice than their less capable peers.. Also ability to cope with failure and set realistic goals. [#SimonB126] Making a great contribution can itself also be a stressor, at least on par with moving residence.

Acquaintances: [#Bloo449] Sometimes the parents themselves did not introduce the student to the talent field, but neighbours, other relatives, siblings, friends of the family, or peers did. The parents usually reinforced the new activity by encouraging it, though.

Acquisition: [#Schm208] The phase of learning that is the 'learning'. Note that acquisition performance is not a perfect indicator of learning. (Tiredness and boredom can also play a role).

Action: [#EW] An action is always an action chosen given a certain situation that aims to turn the given situation into a target situation. Complicating factors are that a) often multiple actions are needed to reach the target situation, b) other agents can have 'wills of their own', and change the situation so that plans do not always work (chess), c) actions are usually probablistic and have a rate of failure, d) you never know the exact situation, you don't have all data so determining the right action can be very tricky (fog of war).  Some data/assumptions may even be false. In addition, one could consider e) no action can possibly achieve the goal state from the initial state, and f) the agent does not have the ability/competence to do the action at this point in time. g) is that the agent lacks knowledge or computational resources. And this even neglects the possibility that h) the goal state is just perceived to be a desirable state, while in actuality it isn't. States can also be 'analogue'/fuzzy instead of discrete. She likes you a bit more or a bit less... The lower the amount of knowledge is and the greater the chance of disruptions due to b/c/d, the lower the ability to 'plan ahead' for multiple actions at the same time.When there are only few states with each a clearly defined best action, knowledge (a mapping) is easiest. When there are many states with however only a few features that really matter, one needs both knowledge of the salient features as the mapping. Finally, the more situations there are with relatively few salient features, extended mapping becomes important and/or greater computational power. [#EW030312] Don't focus on goals as much as on actions: what would I need to do first?

Action trigger: [#Switch209] Similar to SAR: you do something when you get in a certain situation. May work by preloading a decision. Extra useful for difficult goals.

Activation energy: People and students alike have activation energy requirements to do things, and often this need for activation energy produces inertia. Common methods to overcome activation energy barriers with relatively less energy (if the task is mainly psychologically heavy) is splitting up the task into small chunks (“baby steps”), or somehow neglecting the main job “I'm not going to do A, I'm just going to do B”. The expectation of the desirability of the outcome can greatly affect activation energy; for example children can storm out of their beds at 6 am if they expect presents at St Nicholas, for example. As in chemistry, a greatly exothermic reaction (greatly fun thing) will require less activation energy – the more fun something is (or the more important) the less activation energy will be needed – the less fun it is, the more activation energy will be needed, even greater than the natural energy needed for the endothermic reaction. Finally, complexity of a task, unendingness/lack of limits and unclarity also seem to increase human activation energy.

Active experiencing: [#EricB496] Learning a sentence and making (or imagining?) appropriate movements (preferably only related at a higher level; so wanting to interrogate the wife while looking casual) makes learning more effective (but only if actor needs to generate the movement/be creative?)

Active improvement: [#Jurre] All eight talent-methods revolve around scientists thinking and choosing to do what is best for creating good science. {EW: even though some things may be subconscious, like hobbies}

Active learner: [#Hatt37] Passive learners prefer teachers who are organized, have a clear structure and clear learning objectives, active learners prefer teachers who are enthusiastic, promoted interaction in class, and used a variety of teacher approaches. A teacher should strive to maximize the number of active learners.

Active learning: [#Howe124] James Mill encouraged active learning in his son: he had to summarize arguments, transcribe works into his own words, translate from one language into another, give an opposing point of view, and answer searching questions. [#Clar219] Actively constructing a graph seems to increase transfer and understanding in some cases, but just cost time in other cases. Perhaps the secret is that people need to encode elaborately, which is harder when just viewing graphs.

Active participation: [#Stel] If people participate actively in a class, they learn more {because it is more fun? More control? They get feedback?}.

Active recall: [#Supermemo] Effective repetition is based on active recall, try reproduce what you need to know before you check!

Activities: [#Root] There is a strong correlation between the number of different activities and the probability of producing innovative science. [#EW] Let people do something during a workshop or lesson, like clapping or standing up like at the ABC poetry night. (arousal?) [#Lyubom219] When doing an activity, do I feel more the person I want to be or less?

Adams, James L.: [#Adams63] Writer on creativity. Once enrolled in art school.

Adaptive expertise: [#EricB377] Expertise can be routine (good for familiar situations) or adaptive (flexible, on a higher level of abstraction) The best experts in software design have adaptive expertise.

Addictions: [#Nett136] Addictions are often co-morbid (people having several) and run in families; seem to be related to low C more than high E (people can't stop themselves). [# http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201006/the-week-in-willpower ] addicts deal with stress predicts relapse. Those who use avoidance stategies (e.g. distract themselves) have stronger cravings and a higher risk of relapse. Those who use active coping strategies (e.g. think about solutions, ask for help) have a better chance of staying clean. [EW: for some reason this fact seems familiar, as if I've read of it somewhere before, just not in the context of addiction]. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201001/stress-hormone-key-alcohol-dependence] Addiction is generally not about feeling good, but about avoiding feeling bad. [#NS210412] Can people be 'unaddicted' by showing the cues but not giving the drug? [#Int121012] Some people show 'addiction transfer' -probably because through their alleles they have less D2 receptors in their brain. [#SciAmMindNov11] Prairie voles with a partner respond less strongly to amphetamine than single voles do; pair-bonded had as much dopamine, but fewer receptors. So would interpersonal relationships help ward off drug addiction? [#NS080912] Addiction to substances and addiction to behaviours is not neurologically distinct. Note that rats can (slowly) get addicted to food, then be switched to drugs more readily than 'native' rats. [!Perhaps positive, some medication that helps for one addiction can also help for another] [#NRC] Lonely boys with lack of self confidence and social skills run more risks; loneliness is also strengthened by those games. [#NS150314] “Erase your fear...” N-acetyl cysteine boosts brain glutamate levels, which usually drop when addicts try to overcome their habits, and the lower glutamate levels impair communication between prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. [#NS011016MenstruakCycleCleuToAddiction] When progesterone levels are high, women are less sensitive to drugs and take less; but overall women tend to get addicted faster than men. [#Patter194] Rehab often does not work since patients (in contrast to the heroin-addicted Vietnam veterans) tend to return to the same places where they were addicted. Addictions start out by giving pleasure, slowly change in the brain to become about satisfying cravings (septal region). Addictions can be lessened by, when craving strikes, using incompatible meaningful activities, aerobic exercise also helps. [#NS220717StubbedOut] In case of smoking, bans don’t work very much (give rise to smuggling). Increasing costs, decreasing advertising, reducing number of places where can be smokedn, and not showing smoking in movies (or raising age bar – most people start smoking when they are teenagers; and the more teenagers see smoking in movies, the more likely they are to pick it up)

ADHD: [#Wiki] Has symptoms of both inattentiveness and hyperactivity (more rarely only one of two). Often accompanied by impulsiveness. May indicate a lag in biological development of impulse control with age. Beware that symptoms may also appear because of hearing problems, loss in the family, learning problems, anxiety/depression. Linked to dopamine, low-arousal theory states that natural arousal is rather low in ADHD, so children are more aggressively seeking stimuli, since they have less dopamine. Slower development frontal cortex and temporal lobe, faster development of motor cortex. Fidgeting as means of staying awake and alert? Use of stimulants in childhood seems to give a higher risk on schizophrenia and mood disorders in adulthood[?] TV seems to increase prevalence and severity of ADHD, playing in nature and sports seem to work well. 8% of major league baseball players diagnosed with ADHD (3,6% in male children, which decreases when reaching adulthood as people learn to cope and the brains mature (30-50% have persisting problems)) [#Hatt54] Drug treatment may help slightly with behavioural problems, but barely improves academic achievement. School-based programs seem to have a better effect, contingency management for classroom behaviour, cognitive-behavioral procedures for achievement. [#NS16062012] People with ADHD do better on the 'creative uses' test than people whose minds are less prone to wander. [#Davidson158] Regions responsible for selective attention and response inhibition tend to be underactive in people with ADHD, especially the inferior prefrontal cortex, which inhibits impulses. Attention training may help. [#MedicinesDec11] May be caused in 10% by CNVs in glutamate receptors. [#Imagine35] Students with ADHD tend to achieve more in creative enterprises and score higher on creativity tests. [EW: still: scientists with ADHD?] [#NRC221112] Crime decreases with a third if young ADHDers continue taking their medication. [#G&E220911] Mindout game with neurofeedback, may help against ADHD. [#GeurtVanderGlind] People with ADHD are more sensitive for addictions; part may be self-medication to feel more relaxed, part may be because they have lower inhibitory activity of the prefrontal cortex (low C). 10% of drugs and alcohol addicts have ADHD (2.5% is normal in population). Addicts with ADHD also tend to have extra things like depression and borderline, more than 'normal addicts'. Partly perhaps because of genes, partly because they always had more trouble with their social environment: negative social signals, bigger chance to fail school, bigger chance to be fired, get more accidents, have lower chance to finish higher education etc. [#EW] Likely ADHD is an umbrella term for different disorders with different best treatments!

Adjacent possible: [#Newport161] You only find career missions in the 'adjacent possible' of your chosen field. So get to the edge first!

Adjunct aids: [#Hatt207] Videos can be better than pictures, and pictures can be helpful, especially if they're central to the concept being learned instead of decorative. Best use may be that illustrations highlight the central concepts, text discussing the details. Even so, effect seems rather moderate, 0.37.

Administration: [#Meda56] Only bad scientists blame administrative duties for not doing research. (Though Medawar, as a young scientist, also disliked administration and probably avoided it)

Admiration: [#Flourish141] Admiration may have evolved to help you pay attention to someone to more rapidly learn the skill. [#SimonB144] Without admiration, we may not write that many poems and such, or switch to a more admired activity.

Adopters: [#Gawan133] It takes about 17 years for half of the doctors to apply a new treatment; the biggest hindrance seems to be not laziness or unwillingness, but that the necessary knowledge has not been translated into a simple, usable and systematic form.

Advance Organizers: [#Stol100] What in speeches one would call “introductions”, advance organizers give a brief preview of what is to come and link the new material to the old material. As the third of six cognitive strategies, it's very useful too for learning and recall. [#Hatt168] Written advance organizers have less effect, low-ability or low-knowledge learners also profit less. Make sure you include challenge and success criteria.

Adventure programs: [#Hatt157] Adventure programs, especially when cognitively based, have quite decent effects and even positive aftereffects on achievement, personality and leadership (d=0.51). Works especially well for younger children.

Adversity: [#Tonn13] Adversity is always present when trying to achieve fame. [#HaidtH145] Adversity can make people stronger. Can also make their lives more coherent by removing obstacles to happiness that people would never have removed by themselves. [#151] Works best between late teens and into your twenties.

Advertising: [#NS271110HideAndWon'tSeek] If you ban displays of cigarettes in shops, teens are less likely to recall advertising displays and said fewer of their friends smoked (Ireland).

Advice: [#Robi183] Asking a mentee for advice and criticism helps their self-confidence grow.

Aesthetic orientation: [#Ster8] Aesthetic orientation seems to correlate to creativity.

Aesthetics: [#Root03] Aesthetics is the pleasurable feeling one gets when observing beauty (perhaps first evolved for beautiful men/women?) but also extends to art and even more, science {EW: how and why? Perhaps a scientist learns to evaluate formula's as good or bad, but that criss-crosses more easily with the aesthetic sensibilities than the moral sensibilities? Or would some people have easier aesthetic crossover (the creatives), others more moral crossover (the conventionals or such?)}.

Affect: [#Csik96] Talented teenagers feel less unhappy in classes and when alone than non-talented teenagers. [#Csik142] Yet math and science talents feel unhappier during practicing their talent than average during the week (arts/sports higher). Intrinsic motivation ('wish to be doing') parallelled this. [#Draaisma26] Small children judge the affect of an event based on the reactions of their parents.

Affect-laden thoughts: [#Ster288] Affect-laden thoughts may aid creativity. Positive affect/pleasure when challenged may also help creativity.

Affective priming: [#HaidtH27] Technique of briefly flashing something on the screen, so it can only be detected by the subconscious, and then flashing a word or other image, and asking people to press a ‘like’ or ‘dislike’-button (the ‘like-o-meter’). Reaction speed slowed if affect of stimuli is different. Shows for example that almost all white americans have negative ideas about blacks, and some blacks have too.

Affective style: [#HaidtH33] A person’s average or typical level of happiness. Reflects the everyday balance of power between approach system and withdrawal system, can also be seen from brainwaves: more activity in the left prefrontal cortex (happiness) or right prefrontal cortex (unhappiness/fear/shame etc.)

Affiliate: [#McCo824] Affiliating yourself with other professionals (online or in real life) can help sharpen your skills too.

Affiliation needs: [#Adams133] Affiliation needs may make us fear being creative, as you don't want to fail in front of respected peers.

Affirmations: [#Burkem17] Affirmations like repeating “I am a lovable person” may backfire if people have low self-esteem to start with.

Affluence: [#EW/NS..] The wealthier the society, the fewer people want to become scientists. May this be the Xerxes-effect, where exploration is replaced by exploitation?

Against the spin: [#Nett240] Preventing oneself from displaying self-destructive behaviours by preventing one from getting into situations tempting/causing it in the first place.

Age: [#Bloo20] In the phases of talent development, age is less important than the amount of time practiced. [#EricB157] For tasks predominantly dealing with novelty, performance decreases after young adulthood. But in fields where more domain knowledge is more beneficial, performance can rise even through middle age. [#EricB330] Generally productivity declines after the peak, to about 50% of maximum output. In some cases career age determines the location of the peak, in other cases (some forms of leadership, sports) chronological age is more important. [#EricB462] At least older pianists can maintain piano skills by intensive practice, even though general cognitive skills decline as in other people {so if you could stop extra demyelination with ageing...?} [#EricB595] Gf, Gs and SAR decline with age. (and are also most vulnerable to brain damage. Link?) [#EricB730] When one gets older, you need more deliberate practice to attain the same level of skill; deliberate practice seems to get less efficient. The zero correlations may be that older experts develop compensatory mechanisms (for example, more knowledge/better anticipation to compensate for decrease in Gs). But perhaps not ALL fields of expertise can be maintained that way {physical expertise would be an example} [#EricB736] Some hobbies (like bridge) seem to help keep working memory capacity, but it is unclear whether this is a real effect or just a result of selection. [#Crop36] Did Newton notice that his powers for creative work were fading in his 50s, and therefore moved from Cambridge to London? [#Vumagazine, Dahlhaus] In children's brains there are more proteins in the synapses that are suitable for increasing synapse flexibility, increasing learning speed. In adults, most proteins reinforce existing connections, increasing speed and efficiency. [#NS210712] Winning sportspeople: men's 100 metres 22.8 years old, men's marathon 27.8 years old, men's 400 metres free style swimming: 19.9 years old. When ageing, fast-twitch fibers change to slow-twitch, cognition declines, and lung capacity does as well. [#Strien291] Many scientists have a second peak around age 60 or even 80, possibly to having fewer administrative obligations, or because of revival of early memories.

Aggression: [#Wallin33] Giving in to aggression (hitting a child once) does not blow off steam, it only increases the anger, so the later slaps are more vehement than the first slap {EW: runaway emotions, or Checkov's proprioceptive feedback loop}

Agitation: [#SellHuman40] Agitation, in constrast to irritation, is making people do something they want to do. “Leading with your ears instead of your mouth”. Tell people “I need your expertise”.

Agreeableness: [#Nett178] While creative potential is related to Openness, actual success in a creative pursuit is related to low agreeableness; success in business is related to lower agreeableness as well. [#Pers3] But disagreeableness can also lead to loneliness, as you need to push others out of the way (not just competitors, but your friends and family as well). [#Int02032012] Nice men earn 18% less than men who don't describe themselves as nice. For females the effect is just 5% [https://hbr.org/2014/12/rethink-what-you-know-about-high-achieving-women] It would seem as if young graduates of Harvard Business school focus on job titles, job levels, and professional promotions; 20 years later they strive for raising happy children, have meaningful work, contributing to the world around them.

Aha-erlebnis: [#EW] Aha's may feel great, because a random combination is found that is for something very important.

AI: [#NS250812] Watson is being trained by IBM on oncology data (may help with the flood of it). [#NS170115] Top poker program (Cepheus) is impossible to beat by humans in 2-player heads up limit hold 'em.

AIM: [#Inter”SpreekVrijuit”] Language learning method in which students communicate from the start exclusively in the target language, though they can use gestures to aid their communication. Reading and writing are reserved for later. Compared to conventional classes, students increase their vocabulary more quickly, and understand and speak more French, making more complex constructions when writing, though with a larger amount of spelling errors.

Alcohol: [#Weiner39] Alcohol helps the incubation stage, but hampers the verifcation stage (note that the greeks drank diluted wine and from shallow cups, that encouraged sipping, not gulping).

Alcohol consumption: [#NS120113] Alcohol consumption can best be curbed by banning advertising, increasing price, and restricting availability. 10% heaviest drinkers consume about 45-55% of alcohol, making industry less than willing to curb that behaviour. Minimum pricing (what the consumer must pay) more efficient than hiking taxes (which the retailers can partially absorb) [#NS170115DrivenToDrink]. Regardless of socioeconomic group, people who work more than 48 hours per week drink more alcohol than people with standard working weeks.

Alembert (Jean le Rond d'Alembert): [#EricB556/wiki] Mathematician, son of smart infantry officer and courtesan/author. Adoptive parents apparently disliked maths, but his father paid for good schooling.

Algorithms: [#EW/Laird] the brain may not be able to perform fundamentally different algorithms than a computer, but the presence of noise may make the result less predictable.

Alienation: [#EW] Alienation may take place when you get bogged down in routine, obligations and details, and forget why you're doing something in the first place (for example, to create joy or beauty). [#Hofste304] Alienation is a perception of the workplace, may be associated with neuroticism (or different values)

Alignment: [#Larkey, Connectionist Analogy Builder] Objects with alignable differences (differences in same dimensions) tend to be remembered better and are judged as more similar than objects with unalignable differences.

Alive: [#Greene105] Would it have helped Faraday that due to his faith he saw everything animated/alive with the presence of God, and therefore more wonderful?

All-or-none-processes: [#Gawande36] The name of processes where skipping a single step destroys the result completely; for this, faulty memory and distractions can be fatal, checklists very useful.

Allen curve: [#Imagine153] Someone is 10x as likely to communicate with a colleague who sits at a neighbouring desk than with someone who sits more than 50 meters away.

Allen, Debbie: [#Robi117] Was always dancing as a young girl, inspired by the photographs of ballerinas, and loved watching the circus and dancing movies.

Allochtone women: [#Int060511] Women of Turkish/Arabian descent have to cope with brothers which are very spoiled; they learn that they need to work hard and be smart for success. The boys are less adaptable, and less willing to adapt themselves to a 'lower' position in a company,

Allomothers: [#NRC131110] Hrdy: in hunter-gatherer communities, babies are passed from mothers to many 'allomothers' – 5 to 24 of them. The more allomothers a child has, the greater the chance that it is alive after 3 years. Male allomothers are usually fathers, older brothers and nephews. Female allomothers are usually sisters, aunts and grandmothers. If maternal grandmother is in the same house, mothers are more sensitive to the requirements of the child [ALSO: mothers can never gather enough food for the child on their own-require help from others]. Also gives child more self-confidence and faster cognitive development. Having multiple caretakers can lead to greater empathy and the ability to combine diverse points of view.

Almost-good-idea: [#Jaffe33] An almost-good idea is dangerous, especially if it has protean properties like Becher's phlogiston; it blinds scientists to the truth, diverts them from a true interpretation (like a decent pet theory needing much more evidence against it). Always beware a theory that explains everything but does not seem to give the right prediction for some things.

Alternative: [#EW/Persu] How attractive an action looks also depends on its alternatives.

Altucher, James: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsuCFL-SQLg] Likes to create and sell companies, does not like to run them. Also tries to think of at least 10 ideas per day, otherwise thinks that his idea muscle will atrophy [37:29]. Thinks that only worthwhile goal is freedom: freedom from hatreds and regrets, anxieties; free from other people's opinion of you and the opinion of the masses. Don't say “can't” but “I can” (so not: I can't become a professional basketball player, but I can become an agent or a writer. Interesting: takes one's interests as guidelines to a career. But is that really the best way, given the genesis of interests?

Alzheimer’s disease: [#NS290417WhyIsALzheimersOnTheRise?] in women, longer estrogen exposure delays Alzheimer, likely because estrogen has antiinflammatory properties. [#NS290417WhatCanYouDoToAvoidDementia?] A rise in educational attainment and better control of cardiovascular issues have decreased incidence of dementia.

Amateurs: [#RoadToExcel25] Most amateurs spend virtually all their time on playful social activities, not on deliberate practice. When people give up on their goal to succeed in a domain, their time spent drops to the level of regular amateurs (as deliberate practice is not enjoyable, it's instrumental, a means to an end). Desire to succeed is called as most important by coaches.

Amazing: [#EricB565] Amazing friends and family can also count as an extrinsic motivator, especially for math prodigies.

Ambiguity: [#Ster42] Creative people have a higher tolerance for ambiguity.

Ambition: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126746-2,00.html] Ambition needs both a goal and energy. [PlanckBiog] Before he began his studies at the University of Munich he discussed the possibility of a musical career with a musician who told him that if he had to ask the question he'd better study something else. [#Busa163] Excellers always want to do more, do better. Being contented is something excellers distrust.[#EW/Zill] Is there a secret of 'always wanting more', that the biological organism keeps us stressed on a tightrope between wanting even more and not daring to risk what one has, between greed and fear? [#Packer15] Some people from the lower classes focus on drinking and racing and fucking, don't seem to have any ambition – in reality, may not have parents who believed one could achieve more in life, or that it was worthwhile. Or less N?

Ambitions: [#Schmidxiv] Most people/teams are not very ambitious; they assume things to be impossible (and don’t bother to check the physics) so they don’t expend energy on it.

Amotivation: [http://www.oratiereeks.nl/upload/pdf/PDF-4662weboratie_Oostdam_-_DEF.pdf] Amotivation is a separate factor (different from motivation), if people don't value an activity, don't see it as relevant to their goals, or think they are incompetent in it.

Amusement: [#Sidis, EWL] As a society, we spend vast resources on amusement, in the form of sponsoring sports, television, radio, theatre, movies, computer games (and to a lesser extent, museums). People who are expert in amusing others (such as soccer players and comedians) therefore earn much more money than people with other areas of expertise (say, mathematicians), even though there are far fewer paid positions in amusement. The few get much, whereas in science, the many earn little. {both groups are essentially information producers though, but their markets are vastly different}

Amy-effect: [#EW260413] Most of us are not very competent in most things we do; we could be much more competent (to our advantage), but as long as we're 'good enough' we never take the trouble to improve. Only in times of crisis (like financial problems) can we grow.

Amy-lesson: [#EW260413] Most people (and organizations) are 'lazy'; they spend their resources on other things even though some problems can easily be foreseen and prevented.

Amygdala: [#Davidson71] Activity in the left prefrontal cortex shortens the period of amygdala activation (EW: so smile genuinely after a setback?}. High activation in amygdala (and low in fusiform gyrus) for 'puzzled' people (autists are afraid of looking into the eyes of others). Oxytocin when sprayed in someone's nose goes directly to the amygdala, so may increase bonding by decreasing amygdala activity. [#Davidson222] Activity in the amygdala means feeling distress; which can inhibit the desire to help. {EW: good samaritan?} [#Nelissen173] Tells cortex to pay more attention to stressor. Also needed to control anger.

Anagram-rule: [#Syed73] People solving difficult anagrams remember the words better than those who solve easy anagrams. {EW: why? Was the search more intense and therefore the reward/emotion and therefore memorazibility greater? Did they make more connections? Or did they simply spend more time?}

Analogies: [#Clar187] Analogies are very effective learning tools in building correct mental models; they however only work if the learner is familiar with the first element of the analogy, the analogy is from a different domain to prevent confusion. And note that learning from analogies may take more time than from other instructional aids. [#EW/JohnClement] Would analogies be useful in getting ideas, for creating models (like Maxwell did?) [#Strien54] Would creativity be helped by analogy with something else? [Freud sublimation, Kepler: God as sun]. Of course, some analogies live so much in one's mind (Kepler-God) that no real external stimulus is needed. [#77] Can be overused, and block aspects of reality (the universe is not really a clock) [#177/EW] Would generating different analogies for something help discovery? [#348] Some analogies may be found bad on moral/emotional grounds (Einstein / quantum mechanics).

Analogizing: [#Root03] Sixth thinking tool, analogizing is recognizing a functional likeness between two or more otherwise unlike things. [#VanStrien106] Picking and using analogies may be important in scientific discovery. [#Hargit85] Raman, when hearing about X-ray scattering, reasoned that that should be possible with light as well, and that he wanted to find out.

Analysis: [#Adams46] Process whereby there usually is a right answer (obtainable by following appropriate steps from a well-defined problem statement.) Compare to judgement (choosing from several answers). Synthesis: where there is an infinitiveness of possible answers.

Anchor: (NLP) A conditioned stimulus of a conditioned stimulus-response combination. For example, a symbol like the flag is an anchor for patriotism. However, anchors can also be very individual. In general, the anchoring stimulus needs to be very specific to work. (cognitive science)

Androgen/estrogen hypothesis: [#Eyse275] 'Hard' scientists often marry later and have fewer children than social scientists, and are more 'androgynous' in sexual orientation. Is explained in the GTC model.

Androgynity: [#Csik78] Some of the characteristics of talented males are a bit more feminine, whereas the talented females are a bit more masculine; one needs a bit more order but also more bravado to succeed in something. The most productive scientists score high both on the masculinity and femininity scales {EW?}

Anger: [#NS050507] Anger makes us impetuous, selfish and risk-prone. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201009/what-the-text-messages-911-can-teach-us-about-coping-and-recovery] In contrast to other 'negative' emotions, anger is an 'approach' emotion, which makes us feel stronger, makes us feel right, makes us feel important, and makes us feel in control. May be a 'self-medication' for grief or fear, for example in the USA after 9/11. [#NS090213] Angry people are less afraid of being hurt in a terrorist attack, and more willing to support an aggressive response (latter one: duh!). People who report feeling angry rather than happy when confronting people report higher well-being overall. Angry people also brainstorm in a more unstructured way (good?). Anger seems the best emotion for uniting people with a shared conviction and prompt them to take action. Women are accorded lower status than males when they show anger. Europeans and Americans make larger concessions to an angry opponent, Asians do the opposite. Strong men and beautiful women are angrier than weak men and less attractive women. People who generally suppress their anger in disputes with their partners die earlier than those who let anger out and solve conflicts [EW: emotional suppression not good] [#Imagine161] Anger gives a short burst of more and more novel ideas than a neutral mood, but performance quickly declines due to exhaustion. [#Nass153] If the other is angry, blame people!~ [#Nelissen95] Anger both mobilizes energy and helps overcome obstacles to achieve a goal. Stronger when the obstacle is an opponent who blocks your goal on purpose. Anger can prevent aggression if other party notices it and shows even stronger anger, of if the other party apologizes or makes amends! Can be incited ('your wife was good in bed') to make people perform better on things that need strength or motorical skills. Anger is also to protect self-image, which is important for our social choices. Anger and high 'self-image' can therefore lead to aggression. [#Nelissen104] Anger makes us not realize how much we are affected by it, how grossly misproportioned our reactions have become. [#EW/Els] Does our anger show us (and others) our closest values and/or greatest fears? [#HaidtH25] You can lessen your anger by seeing things as more normal (like fortune being naturally fickle) and being grateful for the blessings you received as long as you did.

Angles: [#Greene167] Experiment and look at a problem from all possible angles. [#271] Oceanian navigators saw the canoe as being still and the islands as moving; helped them orient on the stars. [#295] Futch also had a epiphany while watching videos of other fighters. He had been focusing on strategy – but tics could be more productive!

Anhedonia: [#McGon131] People with anhedonia don't expect pleasure from activities [so little dopamine?] Depressed people's brains can't sustain a long burst of dopamine.

Animations: [#Clar99] Animations work less well than static frames, perhaps because static frames force people to take on a higher cognitive load since they must make their own animations, perhaps because people can look through the frames in their own tempo, reducing cognitive load.

Annie method: [Margriet Oostveen] Keeping Dutch skills up in the US by having lots of books of Annie M G Schmidt and often playing audiobooks of her.

ANNK1: gene that regulates dopamine release, people with the A2/A2 allele are 22% more likely to be able to quit smoking than heterozygotes and A1 homozygotes (which together form 1/3 of the white population). Obesity and drug addiction may also be influenced by this gene.

Anomaly: [#Greene214] Read widely, journals and books from all different fields, find an anomaly in your field or a different field that seems promising. If the anomaly calls your own beliefs and assumptions into question, so much the better.

Anomie: [#HaidtH175] A condition of society in which there are no clear rules, norms, or standards of value. Breeds feelings of rootlessness and anxiety and leads to an increase in amoral and antisocial behavior. Health of a neighbourhood correlates to the degree in which adults respond to the misdeeds of other people’s children.

Anorexia: [#Zill181] “Drive for thinness” correlates with watching music videos (among young women). Beautiful women are also equated (by females!) to power. [#NS160116 People with anorexia have stronger neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum.

Antecedent: [#Tigg146] Antecedents can be social or physical. Antecedents are not so effective as consequences at changing behaviour.

Anterior superior temporal gyrus: [#Imagine17] Part of brains (above right ear) that becomes very active seconds before an epiphany (but silent if problems solved by logic)

Anthropomorphism: [#NS171110] Chimpanzees treat thunder storms like rival males, pulling off branches and screaming. Perhaps we are programmed to see human actions behind everything. We tend to anthropomorphize more if situations or entities are less predictable (children treat unpredictable robots like humans); or when we're lonelier. Activates the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area we use for thinking about other people's thoughts. Lonely (or loneliness-primed) people also anthropomorphize their gods more with traits like thoughtful, considerate and sympathetic. May reduce stress. Of course, people may also get angry at machines for that reason; Amazon.com's robots blame cracky phone lines, making people more willing to repeat themselves. Appear to be trying hard without appearing to be stupid. Anthropomorphism also can see volition behind a streak – dangerous, as people seeing volition are more likely to assume that the streak will continue. And if people feel powerful, they also rather play with human-like slot machines. Also inverse: people who feel more socially connected see less humanity in other people, so endorse torture.

Antisocial: [#NS130413] Antisocial people have 1% less grey matter in their prefrontal cortex. Male offenders also tend to have impairments in their automatic nervous system, perhaps making them fearless and risk-taking to compensate for chronic under-arousal (also have lower heart rates) Giving children from 3-5 years extra nutrition, exercise and intellectual enrichments makes the brains at age 11 mature faster than kids from a comparable background outside the programme, and showed 35% less criminal behaviour a decade later [Adrian Raine – Anatomy of violence]

Anxiety: [#Eyse189] Anxiety seems to correlate negatively with the effectiveness of intuition. {EW: gah... anxiety = aroused = tunnel vision} [#Mehr149] Correlates positively with smoking and alcohol use, and negatively with physical activity. [#Csik10] Anxiety can be the result of too-high expectations of the teacher and hence interfere with learning, while boredom is the result of too-low expectations {EW... hmm.. I don't entirely agree. Anxiety also needs people to feel that failure is bad} [#Csik235] Anxiety, or too high challenge for the skills, seems the predominant difference between uncommitted and committed teenagers... so teachers should try reduce anxiety to produce flow? [#Hatt50] Reducing anxiety is a decent way to improve learning (d=0.40), so try to avoid anxiety-producing test options as 'none of the above', or word problems with extraneous information. [#Wise115] Anxiety can make people more accident-prone, and suppress their immune system. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shyness-is-nice/201109/what-cartoon-taught-me-about-cognitive-behavior-therapy] CBT: first expose yourself to mildly anxiety-producing situations. Do it regularly enough. Make exposure prolonged, until you're comfortable with it (so learn that the anxiety goes away, don't stop while you're feeling anxious). And good self-talk “I'm a big, brave dog” (or such). [#PinkDrive144] One possible cause for anxiety and depression in high attainers is that they don't have good relationships. {EW: or that they always want more, or feel they should have more?} [#NS16062012] An anxious mood leads to a high degree of focus, not good for originality. [#McGon110] Anxiety, when coupled with self-stimulating, suggests craving/addiction (would anxious people therefore be addicted more easily?).

Apathy: [#Csik171] A term Csikszentmihalyi uses to describe the state of being unskilled and unchallenged (in contrast to skilled and unchallenged, which is boredom).

Aphantasia: [#NS230416BlindInTheMind] Some people can't visualize things (like Craig Venter), though they can usually perform tasks requiring 'visualization' quite well. Some may have something like 'blindsight' (not conscious of what they do), others may just use compensatory pathways.

Apologizing: [#SciAmMindNov11] Agreeable people apologize sooner, people with very low or very high self-esteem (narcissists) don't. Sense of justice is also negatively correlated.

Application: [#Watt140] Would trying to think of an application of the things you learn help? [#Clar209] Applying rules brands them in memory better than regurgitating them. [#Clar372] Centering learning around job-related applications increases motivation by a lot! [#NS170410] The atomic bomb was not at the frontier of science, but it was a huge challenge of innovative technology and brute industrial effort.

Appreciation: [#Haring/#Carn/#EW] People want to be successful due to a desire/longing/hunger for appreciation.

Approach: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201202/try-willpower-experiment-making-smarter-healthier-choices] Approaching something/getting physically closer to it can increase the attraction or decrease the repulsion you have for something {a Chekov-variant; act as if you like it?} Imagining yourself approaching or using something has the same effect! {what if you'd wake up in this house? What would you use this room for? - though may also be more mental load}

Approaching: [#EWL] Do the most interesting thing in your job/least uninteresting/ or at the very least something at least a bit interesting that goes in the global direction

Appropriation: [#John199] 'Absorbing' some of the skills or personality of your collaborators {EW: would your worldview be influenced by the beliefs of others around you?} {however, collaborators tend to develop a 'distributed mind' – so skills are not shared rather diverging; attitudes may be}

Approval: [#Bron83] What really motivates (young?) children is approval of the parent; approving the right behaviour is much more effective than punishing wrong behaviour.

Archimedes: [#Strien30] Long before Hiero's crown, had written a piece of 47 pages on floating bodies – had thought about objects in water for quite some time, therefore.

Area: [#RootAOI] The number of areas a scientist works in correlates to the number of significant discoveries.

Arena: [#Bloo506] Next to role models, the future top students had public arenas where they could demonstrate and test their skills and derive rewards.

Argument assignment: [#Clar209] Of writing essays on a subject, an argumentative essay (presenting two opposing viewpoints with pros and cons) works better (better transfer) than summarizing the sources, trying to create a consistent narrative, or an explanation of what happened.

Arguments: [#HaidtH20] Most arguments are really confabulation originating in our instincts/feelings.

Aristotelean happiness: [#NS/EW] In contrast to 'Epicurean happiness' (enjoying sensory and social pleasures), Aristotelean happiness involves doing things that you perceive as having value. {EW: would this also be the distinguishing part of Robinson's 'element'?} {and perhaps the joy of learning is also considered valuable...but then differently than sensuous joy} {the kind of 'good pride', in contrast to regular enjoyment or 'beat them'-pride?}

Arousability: [#Mehr181] While arousability in itself is not a sign of psychological maladjustment, it seems to correlate to emotional thinking. In any case, arousability is negatively correlated not only to physical success, but also to all other success measures. [#FransDeWaal/ZannaClay/PNAS] Bonobos with higher arousability (continue screaming after stress) are less likely to comfort other bonobos. Is this arousability or self-control/sensitity to feelings/flexibility?

Arousal: [#Zill192] People who are aroused (for example by exercise) tend to be primed more strongly, think more stereotypically. [#Zill201] Arousal is a sort of alarm, which is transformed into an emotion by cognitive labeling, often leading to actions to remove the cause of arousal. [EW: generally, arousal seems to be a (physiological) call for action] [#EW030713] Does arousal (after discussions with Kick) increase interest in for example New Scientist articles? [#NS290613] Arousal is also when you expect something (like a hand touching 'your' rubber hand). [#Nass143] Most people like to manage their arousal, not making it too high or too low for too long a time. [#145] Avoid presenting aroused people with even minimal negative experiences, as their arousal can quickly turn to anger and acting out. [#147] Never reason with aroused persons, as aroused persons focus on doing rather than thinking, they start feeling negative about you and it will even increase their arousal (and you'll become the target). Better by controlled emotional contagion in the desired direction, hard though it is since excitement and negative emotions are more contagious than calm and positive emotions. [sympathetic nervous system and right side of the brain are more powerful than para/left] [#Sommers129] Giving people adrenalin makes them more likely to be infected with anger or joy by an action who is 'also filling in the questionnaire'. [#Huijts2012] There may be a 'need for arousal' (EW: optimal level, like challenge?) [#Eyse268] Lower arousal would help creativity, but creative people are usually more neurotic (especially the artists) or introverted, which also gives higher arousal! This may be because their arousal is much more varied; it may be generally higher, but it IS lower during creative acts. [#Pino28] Low arousal may be helpful in remembering data; try to stay calm on tests {and calm during learning? Or would you need higher arousal for better memorization? Perhaps higher arousal for lower complexity?} Low arousal (calmness) cannot be reached in an instant; one needs to take time and perhaps resting rituals. [#Ster140] See research of Hull: higher arousal leads to more clichéd responses, lower arousal to more variable responses, and a flatter associative hierarchy. Almost any mental task produces higher arousal, creative people can however decrease their arousal when creative thinking is needed/asked for. [#EricB396] Writers maintain lower arousal as a protection against the many negative emotions (despair, fear of evaluation, perfectionism, impatience) that accompany the early stages of writing, like Osler learned not to worry too much. [#EW] Teachers must maintain arousal within a certain range: too low arousal will make the students create external arousal (seek or produce distractions (talk to each other, fidget)) or create internal arousal (daydreams). Too high arousal, and the students cannot think intelligently due to conscious-narrowing. Alternating increasing and decreasing arousal (like in a story) may be ideal for catching attention. [#Clar115] A teacher can manage arousal by optimizing the physical parameters of the environment (temperature, lighting, food, ventilation), decrease fatigue by interspersing breaks and activities, and making learners accountable for outcomes that optimize the effect of stress. For example, require people to provide proof of their learning ('Competency based instructional models) such as writing a report after the learning. [#Simo44] Higher arousal makes high-probability associations more probable and lower-probability-associations less so. [#Adams80] Arousal (like being in a crowd) makes weird objects more difficult to describe (perhaps because of the complexity of the task or because people feel obliged to start describing early). [#Loehrs178] Smiling: reduces arousal, short-circuits flight-or-fight response.

Arousal potential: [#Simo170] Too novel/original art (too high arousal) or too predictable art (too low arousal) score low on success – the best art produces intermediate arousal.

Arrhenius: [#Jaffe167] Decided together with Ostwald (and van 't Hoff?) to uproot old theories in chemistry; was 25 at the time (Ost 31, tHoff 32). Was a dreamer, but admitted to university at age 17, the youngest and brightest pupil of his year. Excelled in maths and sciences. Had Berzelius as kind of role model. But also did experiments next to dreaming about salts in solution. Was an accurate and patient worker. Since he also investigated diluted solutions, found that laws of conductivity were much simpler there. Went to his parental home to work on the theoretical part of his dissertation. Just focused on conductivity and its formulas, awake and asleep. Had very good memory, could remember all experiments and even long strings of numbers. Was cautious enough not to insult the professors and their current theories too much, but was nevertheless disappointed about the lukewarm reception by his 'superiors'. Decided to find allies, so to be stronger in the battle. The eminent professors did not pay much attention, old, weak, distracted or rusted. But Ostwald, proponent of all new theories, listened. Arrhenius worked first almost a year with Ostwald, then with Kohlrausch, who had discovered that all ions of an element behaved similarly (Arrhenius also considered Kohlrausch a great experimentator, that he could learn a lot from him). Devoured all publications in his area, including the one of Van 't Hoff. Also worked with Ludwig Bolzmann in Graz [physicist!], also went to meet Max Planck, a revolutionary as well. Collaboration with Van't Hoff was very friendly and trusting and cooperative, but Arrhenius missed the energy of Ostwald. {interestingly, chemists claimed that the dissociation theory was completely incomprehensible, even while it's nowadays taught to highschool children} {and three committee members disagreed, Kelvin to Christiansen, from 'nonsense' to 'brilliant'}. After that Arrhenius thought about many areas of science, including cosmology and language, though his theories were not generally accepted there. [E: open mind!} Had relatively little interest though in arts and literature {though he wrote popular-scientific work} Also not very politically active.

Arrogance: [#Seth106] Would scientists have the tendency to see people in other fields as less smart and enlightened, plodding around without true vision (as Planck did regarding the chemists with their 'molecules'?)

Art students: [#Csik69] Art students score a bit lowish (60%). Csik claims that it is because of their focus {but it is also possible that higher N/creativity does make them less self-disciplined} [#Csik75] Female art students are sexually more liberal and have a less close family, for other talented females it is the reverse.

Artists: [#Ster275] Artists score higher on fantasy and openness to experience, impulsivity and lack of conscientousness, anxiety, affective illness, and emotional sensitivity. Artists seem not more likely to suffer from 'normal' depression, but bipolar disorder is much more prevalent. More drive and ambition (Nach). Norm-doubting, non-conformity and independence. Also hostility, aloofness, unfriendliness, and lack of warmth. Finally introversion, unless the person is an actor or opera singer.

Arts: [#Root] While most scientists are not very interested in the arts, the most successful are. {EW: could that be because artists tend to observe very well? Or because they tend to play more?} [#EW] Arts may, like Robinson says, indeed be a valuable addition to schools, even though there are relatively few teachers of drawing or music who can truly inspire their students (see, for example, Paul McCartney's music teacher). [#EricB783] In contrast to sports, arts does not improve in any quantitative way, things are merely required to be new, like 'poured paintings' or 'found objects'. {or do those scientists have more creative (or 'female'?) personalities? [#Hatt143] Arts have some positive effect on figural creativity, but no effect on verbal/conceptual creativity. [#Hargit125] Aunt of Carleton Gardusek was prominent entomologist and introduced him to leading scientists and artists [note: she lived in New York city] [# Art for Art’s Sake? The Impact of Arts Education ] Arts education does not seem to have an impact on academic performance, with the possible exception of music lessons.

As if: [#Tonn109] Many later famous people dreamt of fame, even added (fake) microphones to their interior or imitating/parodying famous persons in private. [#Wise110] People pretending to be fighter pilots responded much faster to a light flashing than the control group (?more playful/relaxed, or other brain circuits activated)

Asperger: [#NS140401] Some people with Asperger panic at the unexpected, others don't as long as they can see it as a logical problem,

Aspiration: [#EricB464] Expert musicians showed higher aspiration than amateurs, and a more positive attitude to performance, but not more motivation{!? Remember aspiration is not the same as motivation!}[#Pers4] Your aspirations as a teenager determine your occupational success later. [#PinkDrive80] Aspiring for money, fame or beauty leaves you in poorer psychological health than if you just strive for autonomy and intrinsic motivation. [#EW] Would aspiration be the difference between the current state and another state? But how does it differ exactly from motivation?

Assertive communication: [#Seligm174] 5 steps: 1 identify and work to understand the situation; 2. describe the situation objectively and accurately. 3) express concerns 4) ask the other person for his/her perspective and work towards an acceptabel change 5) list the benefits that will follow when the change is implemented.

Assimilation: [#CIAch3] Assimilation is the second of three learning methods (next to rote learning and mnemonic aids), involves connecting new knowledge to existing knowledge. Is very efficient, but can be hard for truly new knowledge.

Assimilator: [#Ster65] Assimilators try to extend a certain problem-solving strategy as far as it can be stretched. Benefit from instruction to explore and visualize. Contrast to explorers.

Associated/Disassociated: Whether you imagine actions from a first-person perspective or a third-person perspective. A first-person perspective usually gives much stronger emotional charge {importance!}, however, a disassociated view is suitable if one wants less emotional charge, which can lead to more solutions; emotional thinking usually grabs the first solution that comes into mind; non-emotional thinking levels the playing field and gives more ideas the chance to come to the consciousness. “Write when you’re drunk, revise when you’re sober” is a variation on this. A person needs to be able to both access the associated state which gives energy and power to pursue goals, and the disassociated state, which gives creativity and flexibility, and to be able to consciously switch between them when needed.

Association: [#Watt185] Remembering as much of something helps memory (so not only name of fish, but also where you saw it, how it looked, how big it was..) Can also be loose association (Naso- man with big nose) or contrast (Goliath->David). Whatever you can associate with it! {EW: see also 'connecting', even though connecting may be a more specialized form that looks for similar or related content} {it's easier to learn a lot than it is to learn a little!} [#Kluw72] Learning visual-verbal relations gives recall as well as visual-visual, apparently connecting different memory areas is not hard at all. [#EW/Boekaerts8] Association is important for learning, if a new piece of knowledge can't connect to any existing knowledge, it can't be retrieved and is therefore 'forgotten'. [#EW] Human memory works with association, computer memory does not – what would happen if we would make computer memory associative? Associations are valuable to retrieve related data. If two facts or objects or persons are somewhat linked together, such as the smell of cigars reminding one of one's grandfather. Human memory (and especially memory retrieval) mostly works through association, even though many associations do not reflect objective reality but rather personal experiences [EW: so room for human variation and creativity]. Associations can be stronger or weaker, and multiple inputs can also strenghten or weaken them. Associations tend to reinforce themselves, but that can be counteracted (computers don't work with associations like humans do (except in some neural networks): associations are kind of boolean and often uni-directed (true/false) rather than an analogous number. Associations are valuable to retrieve related data.

Associative hierarchy: [#Ster139] On word association tasks, creative people take longer to run out of responses than uncreative people, so seem to have more remote associations.[#Simo80] Associative hierarchies can be steep (every concept only has few links to other words which are found with high probability) or flat (many links, with lower probability of each link). Creativity would be related to flatter hierarchies. Sometimes measured by Remote Associates Test (or RAT). Steepness of the hierarchy gives rise to a continuum between “analytical geniuses” and “intuitive geniuses”. Note that a hierarchy can be “too flat” for a specific purpose; 'moderately odd responses' by scientists are more correlated to success than 'really odd responses'. There is probably an optimal level of flatness for every type of endeavour.

Associative isocortex: [#Kluw55] Those parts of the cortex that do not contain primary sensory or motor areas, but are involved in processing high-order information coming from them. The posterior parietal cortex (a bit behind the top of your head) is one of those areas.

Associative richness: [#Simo28] One of the prerequisites for creativity seems to be that different ideas can be randomly combined in a seething, bubbling cauldron of ideas {EW: but those ideas must be present in one's knowledge in the first place!}.

Assumptions: [#Crop21] Huygens assumed that (believed in) Descartes' theorem of mechanical explanations, which made him unable to accept Newton's theory of gravitation [#Whit62] Negative assumptions on solutions can often be removed by asking “what if...” [#Pink28] Our brain can only solve (mathematically impossible) reverse engineering problems by making assumptions about how the world works. Sometimes we make gross errors because we have evolved to have some assumptions that were true in the past, but are no longer true now. [#Laird/EW] Assumptions can in some cases make an impossible problem possible, in other cases they just restrict the search space, speeding up processing.

Astonishment: [#Nelissen111] Astonishment increases our uptake of some information, but thereby decreases our uptake of other information.

Asymptote: [#EricB33] After three years, army personnel reached the asymptote of their ability, though very intelligent subjects reached the asymptote faster, after about one year. Intelligent people seem to reach a higher asymptote on average, though.

Athletes: [#NS241211] Medal-winners tend to be those who are best able to control their emotions and focus their attention, brimming with confidence, motivation and optimism.

Athletics students: [#Csik68] Competition for females is less intense (at least in the lower levels), average class rank is 70%, but large variation between very bright and very dull students.

Atmosphere: [#Hargit124] The research atmosphere in Andre Lwoff's lab at Pasteur institut infected Francois Jacob.

Attachment theory: [#HaidtH113] Children have two basic goals: exploration and safety. Like to get back to the secure base when the anxiety thermostat goes up. Note that about 20% children have avoidant attachment, not returning to mom even if they are distressed [often aloof and unresponsive mothers]. 12% are anxious and clingy, never fully settle down “resistant” [often erratic ad unpredictable mothers]

Attainment happiness: [#EW] Similar to Aristotelean happiness? While epicurian happiness is related to intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation being caused by a lack of happiness? {So would unhappy people be more extrinsically motivated, like Maria asking me what was in it for me to write the talent document?}

Attainment value: [#Clar342] The personal importance of doing well on a task. {EW:? Perhaps Clark means something like: I find good knowledge more important than a clean house?} Compare to intrinsic value and utility value. Attainment value is more about self-image?

Attention: [#Watt175] Paying great attention to things improves memory {and more time = more links?} {EW: impression?} [#Wolt23] The mechanism of attention is to selectively strengthen or weaken impulses; attention is coordinated by the subcortical centres (emotions) as well as the prefrontal cortex. [#Medi74] Better attention equals better learning. Influenced by memory/knowledge, interest/arousal and awareness. Posner described it as a sequence of the alerting/arousing network (background scan), orienting network, and executive network. [#EricB251] Focusing the fovea on something and tracking something else with periferal vision, or shorter/longer fixations on same/other parts influences the outcome of the attention and the speed of a task. [#EricB513] In the first stages of any learning, attention/WM capacity is needed {EW: correlation with IQ?} - interfering with a dual task slows learning. Experts need less attention since more is automated. [#EW] Would attention activate (or help activation of) specific neurons, which then have a greater chance of forming/strengthening connections, also known as learning? [#Clar118] Instructor contact ('roaming the room') also helps attention {EW: like high school teachers do!} 1-3 minutes max else you won't see enough people. Need to switch back to classical if multiple people have the same problem. Cues (like red square boxes or words in bold, or organizers (=content)) help guide attention. Most useful for complex text and/or novice learners. [#Kluw29] Brain areas do not enlarge if the attention is elsewhere or the sensation is not important for getting a reward or such. [#Kluw47] If you pay attention to a modality (for example seeing) the neural response to it will be greater, while the response to other modalities drops! (so don't listen to music while reading) [#Kluw213] There may be a passive and an active control of attention; passive is automatic; but there is also an active process that removes irrelevant information. [#Stol] Like breathing, tends to be automatically controlled. You can take charge of it for a short time, but if you don't spend the effort (or are tired) they revert to automatic. [#NS280505] Improved by higher dopamine (goal-directed) and noradrenaline (vigilant) levels. Saying “stop! Be here now” to yourself when your mind is wandering can also help, though... [#Edu] Can be developed in children with special computer games (www.teach-the-brain.org/learn/attention) [#Wise50] Card trick shows: by directing attention to something (like one card) people forget all cards surrounding it. Similar to the basketball gorilla. [#Franzen245] People who get too little attention can feel unimportant, a 'nobody', and develop depressions. [NRC13012012] Neonatal nurses generally cannot distinguish baby faces better than their peers, but young men being trained for a few days can distinguish baby faces as well as they can distinguish adult faces. [#RoadToExcel34] Attention is necessary for deliberate practice, both for the execution of the task as for monitoring goals, processes and performance. [https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3459]On days they are not sick, many [students] arrive unprepared and late, come and go during class, and use their computers and phones for unrelated tasks during class. ] [#Will8] Paying attention is tiring, that's why travel is tiring, you can't rely on your auto-pilot like you can at home. [#NRC300711] Top sailers pay more attention than amateurs to certain clues like wave patterns, this can be investigated with devices called 'mobile eyes'. For training it helps to develop glasses which black out irrelevant information, or irrelevant timepoints. But perhaps top players also need less time to look at their own boat. [#Davidson86] Attention works both by strengthening the attended signal and inhibiting the non-intended signal; for both activities the prefrontal cortex plays a role. [#NS031101] People with 3x as much time only solve 2x as many puzzles; human mind also closes down excess attention capacity when tasks get simpler. [#Greene38] We may start (or continue) doing something because it gives us attention (money/fame), but if it is not our 'true nature', our performance will suffer and the attention of others will start to decline. [EW: you can internalize values, but that process may be insufficient]. [#Jarrett9/EW] Your job is to make people pay attention – actually, people want to pay attention, that's why they pay artists and such. [#NS230814IntoTheMindsOfBabes] Adults and babies alike become conscious of things in two stages: first 300 ms (or 750 ms for 12-15 months olds, 900 ms for 5-month olds) of observation, then something is perceived consciously. This lag is because the global neuronal workspace (parietal and frontal regions) must become active, and this is not as developed yet in infants, and also the long-distance connections are not myelinated yet. Note that babies are not very able to control their attention and focus on one thing. Smoking and drinking coffee, being in love and traveling to new places also nudge adult brains into paying lots of attention in a wide-eyed, indiscriminate way. [#NS160814It'sAllTooMuch] Whenever we shift attention, we pay a metabolic cost in glucose. Both attention switching and decision making cost lots of glucose.

Attention decrement: [#EricB425] After witnessing a few cases, most people stop observing and label the person 'good' or 'bad' or 'expert' or 'inept', on far fewer observations than would be statistically necessary to do so. Also called the 'primacy' effect (first impressions count!) May be because of costs of further evaluation/information gathering?

Attentional bandwidth: [#Syed213] We can only pay conscious attention to so many things at a time, especially when processes are not automated. Students fell for the gorilla in the basketball field since they needed to count passes; basketball experts did not. Pilots crashed the plane since all their attention went to a faulty light, not to their altitude-meter. Also known as attention overload.

Attentional blink: [#Davidson61] Blindness to stimuli just after a salient stimulus has been represented. [#Davidson208] Seems to be caused by allocating too many resources to the first stimulus; observing in a calm, unattached manner decreases the blink.

Attentional theories: [#Kluw8] Attentional theories try to explain the effects of blocking by positing that stimulus A gets all the attention, so no link between CS B and the US is made. Dominant theory is the modified contiguity theory, however.

Attitudes: [#Robi157] John Wilson was struck blind in a chemistry experiment, yet he didn't consider it a tragedy, went on to study law, and in the end established an organisation for preventing blindness in Africa. Good and bad things happen to us all; it's our attitude towards them and our own possibilities that counts. [#Ster43] The attitude of people (how fast they reject ideas, how much they value new ideas, how much they like new ideas) may also influence their creativity. [#Who167] Attitude is a 'hard cap' – you can't take a superstar and train them on attitude. [#Strien19] Great scientists tend to be quite ambitious and persevering. [#Hooked136] Attitude change is about moving up the utility axis.

Attraction: [#Sommes193] Being told that someone is attracted to you makes them a bit more attractive, perhaps also because you see them in a new light. If it is enough to make you reach for them, it can be kind of virtuous cycle. A shared secret (like secret footsie) also increases attraction. And of course meet as many people as possible, become visible as familiarity breeds attraction. Next to that, create dates that at least produce arousal, for example through physical exertion.

Attractiveness: [#Vonk240611] Extraverts, people with strong egocentrical values (power, success, ambition [EW: because they seem more powerful and high-status, or are even that?]) and narcissists are most attractive. Narcissists are especially attractive due to nice clothes, perceived warmth and charm, sense of humor, and confidence and competence. [#Nass177] Extremely attractive people are seen as less intelligent and less persuasive. Ectomorphs more persuasive than mesomorphs or endomorphs.

Attractor: [#Kluw261] Inputs tend to be diverted into neural 'attractors' – hence we often see what we expect to see.

Attributes: [#Adams109] Listing the different attributes of bricks makes you more likely to come up with novel uses. Or you can even list alternatives to each attribute to come up with some invention (a round brick, a plastic brick, etc.)

Attribution theory: [#Clar347] We generally think of reasons for our successes or failures; which are called attributions. Unfair teacher, not worked hard enough? Stable/unstable, in our control/outside of our control. Controllable attributions are usually better for learning. [#Clar364] Teachers should attribute to controllable causes: always have high expectations, and have clear short-term learning objectives. If not reached, assign extra practice and attribute success to task-specific effort.

Audience: [#Weiner218] Vienna was a very stimulating vity for composers like Mozart and Beethoven, as lots of Viennese were extremely fond of music and many played musical instruments themselves to a very serious amateur level; the appreciation of a good audience was very stimulating.

Authentic tasks: [#EricB289] The tasks young 'talents' performed were real/realistic in their field, genuine. Things that other people in their field were doing and had been doing for years. Also used realistic materials (professional pianos, Olympical swimming pools), and knew these materials and tasks were valued by others.

Authoritarian: [#Eyse108] An authoritarian personality is negatively correlated to creativity. But authoritarian parents do not necessarily eliminate creativity in their children (well, perhaps only in normal children, not in high-P children). [#NRC] Children become less empathic if their mother uses an authoritarian style. {interestingly, at 4-5 years old later aggressive children are as caring as normal 4-5-year olds, but that decreases the next two years. But another possibility is that they get into more arguments: while (at first) caring, they have more difficult/aggressive personalities. [#Adams134] An authoritarian leader can inspire rebellion, even 'passive' rebellion by people not getting any ideas of their own. [#Strien280] Creative people generally did not have a very authoritarian upbringing. Individualistic, non-conformistic, democratic families.

Authority: [#Sidis] According to Boris Sidis, authority is an evil to be avoided in education, as it would merely make the child suggestible and uncritical. {difference between 'having a say' and 'having power', as sometimes a child must do things it does not like {EW: But as evidenced by certain liberal parents, not setting borders ensures that children will widen their borders till they become intolerable to others in society, and giving in to children's demands ensures that they won't be able to handle frustration} [#Gallxiii] Authority can also mean being the author of your own tennis shot? {EW: possibly not being distracted by outside forces?} [#NS240410/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627574.200-brain-shuts-off-in-response-to-healers-prayer.html#.VIi6LMlmr-s] If a supposed healer, authority or 'trusted source/friend' speaks to us, the areas of the brain like the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, which are involved in scepticism, turn off. [#Influence221] Authority is 5th influence-factor, conmen often drape themselves with titles, clothes, appearance (wealth) and trappings of authority. Also, the more important something is, the (physically) larger we remember it. Authority makes the intelligence of the receiver nonfunctioning (dangerous in hospitals {and in business}) Defense: is the authority really an expert? And how truthful can we expect the expert to be here? Note that a bit of truthfulness/arguing against own apparent interest can make authority seem more reliable, so he can have his way (Vincent, the 'helpful' waiter) [#Hargit123] James Black's schoolteacher, when pointed to a problem by James, said that the book was wrong, leaving James with a lasting way of being irreverent in his thinking. [#EW250713] Knowledge may make one more resistant to authority. Lack of knowledge may make one seek authority, but since it's not possible to know who is right if you have no expertise, you look at signs such as wealth. May also be relative importance of being liked or fitting in versus importance of knowledge/correctness.

Autism: [#EW] Like ADHD may have evolved in certain situations(lots of predators), autism-like personality (rigid, detail-oriented) may blossom in complex environments that change relatively little; though probably not the heavy autism that is just a result of massive brain damage. [#NS15102011] Situations that are normally socially rewarding fail to activate brain-reward circuitry in autistic children, so they may find the idea of a good social reputation less rewarding. [#NRC22092012] The same stimulus, when repeated, can activate very different parts of the cortex in autism (perhaps that;'s why autists can look so long at an item) [#Davidson145] In many autists, fusiform region seems okay, it just doesn't receive many signals since people avert their gazes from other people's faces and especially eyes. [#NS230213] Our sense of self drives and is driven by our relationships with other people. Autistic people recognize themselves in a mirror later. And for fewer autobiographical memories. When autists try to access autobiographical memories or when they try to understand other's actions, the same regions (in the prefrontal cortex) show reduced activity. Similarly, social emotions like admiration and compassion tend to activate the posteromedial cortices, another set of regions thought important for our sense of self. [#NS251210] Children with autism may be worse at detecting hidden rules (that lights are in the left half of the room 80% of the time). Are good though at spotting preset visual patterns. [#Int051012] Autistic people have a greater tendency to get addicted to surfing the web. [#NS180910] Some autists may have too much glutamate and too little gaba in their brain, ramping up neural activity and making them sensitive to loud noises and such. [#NS Bowel gene linked to a type of autism] MET-allele linked to type of autism with bowel problems. [#NS061214] People with autism have much less activity in the posterior cingulate cortex when hearing emotion-related actions, like “hugging”. [#NS050915] “Magical world theory”/predictive impairment theory: children with autism have trouble predicting the world, and therefore feel it chaotic and overwhelming.

Autobiographies: [#Eric1] Autobiographies of geniuses are often unreliable because they are usually written decades after the relevant creative accomplishments and youth.

Automatic grading: [#NS030911] Automatic grading (giving students feedback in less than a minute) encourages students to rewrite their answers, and score higher on end-of-term tests. SAGrader, e-rater

Automaticity: [#EricB54] Automaticity may help in complex task by reducing mental taskload making it easier to plan or make correct decisions and consider more information. {EW: for example at playing games at Jeroen's club, all the rules of the game were confusing me, making it hard for me to obey all rules at once and foresee all consequences, since all rules were so unfamiliar and probably took up lots of mental processing} [#EricB59] Automation may free up working memory and thereby lessen the strain on it. [#EricB661] Automatization may not be possible if the task varies a lot {and a little?} [#Clar93] By 'drills' one can reduce working memory load by automating part of the procedure. Drills are only required if one needs to perform quickly on day one, else one can let the automaticity soak in automatically. First phase: accuracy improves; response time slow. Second phase: response time falls dramatically. Games can help here! [#Hatt8] Automation occurs with both expert and experienced teachers, but only expert teachers profit from it because they use the extra brain power available to improve their lessons instead of 'going on auto'. {EW: care more about teaching well?}[#Tigg32] Automatic behaviour comes into being when behaviour is rehearsed a lot. Automatic behaviour (in contrast to planned behaviour) is invoked in times of uncertainty: too little (or too much) information, stress, lack of time. Behaviour happens automatically when it occurs weekly or daily, intentions play a much more important role if the behaviour is rare, say occurs less often than twice a year.

Automation of science: [#NS110409MyNameIsAdamAndImAWhizzWithBakersYeast] Ross King: designed robot that can do experiments, culturing different knock-out yeast strains in absence of a certain nutriment.

Autonomous nervous system: [#Stol] One of the tasks of the ANS is to filter out things the senses notice, but are irrelevant or less relevant. [#Kiefer] By visualisation you can possibly reprogram the ANS to notice specific kinds of stimuli, perhaps because important things form stronger connections with the ANS. {EW: reticular formation?} [#https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/nieuws/2015/januari/Hart-en-vaatziekten-door-slecht-schakelend-zenuwstelsel/] If you're too fat, or if there is an infection, the sympathic system is overstimulated; it's healthy to have a parasympathic nervous system that is often stimulated (also makes you thinner)

Autonomy: [#Ster302] Higher levels of autonomy produce higher levels of intrinsic motivation and hence creativity. [#Stol50] The third of four key adult learning principles. Making decisions increases learning and retention, and also ensures that the learner is more likely to commit to the decision. [#Edu] High school students can be stimulated by independent research and autonomy, just like university students can. [#Hatt193] Student control over learning helps motivation (d=0.30), but has almost no effect at all on achievement (d=0.04). [#http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html] Steve Jobs: the minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. [#DPink65] Autonomy is motivating, but creativity can be preserved if autonomy is relatively smaller, like commissions, if people get useful feedback or the commission encourages them to go into a new and interesting area. [#Franzen257] A very strong need for autonomy can be found in scientists and artists, it can result in unpredictability, egoism, and conflicts with the environment. Too low? Depression and passivity possible consequences. [#PinkDrive91] Businesses granting workers autonomy grow at 4x the rate of control-oriented firms, and have one-third the turnover. Autonomy means autonomy over the four 'Ts': Task Time Technique Team. [#Drive141] Letting doctors spend one day per week on the activities that are most meaningful to them halves the burnout rate. [#Hooked125] Honour autonomy: people may rebel against being forced tp adapt new, unfamiliar, behaviour. [#Stalla79] Autonomy fires up people, as long as it does not exceed their level of competence [EW: confidence?].

Autonomy support: [#Redirect85] Parents try to see things from a child's perspective, help them understand the value of the different alternatives with which they are faced, and convey the sense that the child itself ultimately must choose the path to follow. Parents understand kids, but also provide a rationale for their perspective. [#Ryan2000] Parents who give autonomy support make children more mastery oriented than controlling parents do.

Autopilot: [#Syed72] In most jobs, performance deteriorates instead of improving over the years, this seems to be mainly because concentration is not demanded, and challenges are avoided {like the ice skaters. so lack of emotion? Feedback? Growth?}. Jobs that demand attention, such as firefighters or emergency nurses, are more amenable to constant improvement.

Autotelic: [#Csik80] A self-directing/self-rewarding personality, such as one that directs itself to flow experiences.

Availability heuristic: [#EW] Things that are more striking/spectacular/unexpected/dramatic are remembered better and therefore seem to occur more frequently (and be more believable) than things that are not.

Avery, Oswald: [#Hargit226] Excellent researcher, problem was that he was a quiet and withdrawn person who insisted that results should speak for themselves.

Avogadro: [#Jaffe122] Was too modest to communicate his molecular theory to any other than his students [EW: the Mendel-effect?] First was a lawyer, but at age 23 had enough of all the squibbles in the courts and focused on natural science. Studied natural sciences for years, sent (together with brother Felice) an essay to the academy of sciences about the recently discovered galvanic currents. Not a revolutionist himself, he was a calm, pious man. Was also active in civic functions and committees, took leave from the university at age 74 to spend his remaining years in studying natural sciences.

Avoidance: [#Ferr77] In work, it helps to ask yourself three times a day if you're being productive, or just active/inventing things to avoid the important. [#Sommers248] Approaching an interaction trying to achieve a positive outcome works much better than spending your mental energy on avoiding a bad outcome.

Awareness: [#Weng45] Win Wenger promotes the “What was in your awareness just THEN” exercise. [#Gall95] Try to drag your attention always back to the here and now, instead of to imagined futures or remembered pasts. {EW: like zijnsorientatie?} [#Whit] A good coach can check if the coachee is aware of an important fact. Perhaps this is also why Wenger's descriptive methods work, as they force us to become aware of more properties of something. Awareness includes focused attention, the gathering of relevant facts, and self-awareness for distorting emotions. Not trained by shouting “watch the ball”, but by asking “how high does the ball bounce?”

Awe: [NS300515Awesome views make you… awesome]. Seeing something awe-inspiring (gigantic trees) makes people more helpful, endorse more ethical decisions and lower their sense of entitlement. [#HaidtH203] Awe needs: perceive something vast, and it cannot be accommodated by the person’s existing mental structures. Makes people receptive for new ideas. [#NS290617AwesomeAwe] Feeling awestruck can lower stress, increase happiness, decrease production of cytokines, activates parasympathic nervous system, boost creativity, and make us nicer people. Physically: causes goosebumps. Reduces sense of self, even makes you estimate your body to be smaller. Awe quiets activity in the default mode network. Pyramids and other big structures may have been ‘designed’ to keep people in their place. People who are less religious feel more awe in a space trip [?] Awe also makes us better to remember the details of a short story, as it reduces the activity of expectations and assumptions in the mind. Awe also increases curiosity and creativity, and makes people persevere longer on difficult puzzles. Note that psylocibin and LSD also reduce the activity in the default network.

B&W goal: [#HeaB87] Black and white goals like “no more cheerios”. Not inspiring at all, but can make people rise to the challenge (BP and 'no dry holes')

Babbage: [#Isaac17] Had friends, definitely in Cambridge, where he was in a club to replace Newton's impractical dot notation with Leibniz'. Also had 'scribbling book''

Baby Einstein: [#Redirect80] Children learn words best when parents try to teach them the words; watching videos does not teach more words than the control condition (parents neither showing video nor trying to teach them the words)

Bac-luck cascade: [#Wisema189/EW] If people have bad luck and dwell too much on it, they become clumsy and get more ‘bad luck’

Bach: [#Jarrett10] Bach only let students into his studio if they showed some rudimentary composing ability; would piano lessons have been more fun if I had been allowed to compose a bit as well, to approach music from different directions (like science?)

Background: [#Imagine51] A red background helps for tests that require accuracy and attention to detail, but blue backgrounds generate twice as many creative outcomes.

Backtracking: [#SimonEdison7] Often, in a creative process, the inventor backtracks to earlier abandoned research as a new, more promising research line turns out to be not so promising after all. (Edison: carbon filaments ? metals ? carbon filaments) Oddly, first tests of tungsten were not so good.

Backwards lesson design: [#Hatt245] Starting not with the favourite lesson or book, but with the learning goals, and experimenting with the best methods to reach them.

Bacteria: [#NRC010211] Bacteria in the intestines influence the behaviour of mice, 'sterile' mice showing more exploratory and risk-seeking behaviour.

Bad: [#HeaB46] “Bad is stronger than good”-principle: we pay more attention to bad things, think about them more, remember them better, and weigh them more heavily. Also known as 'positive-negative asymmetry'

Baker/Baker effect: [#Foer45] People tend to remember better that someone is a baker than that his/her last name is baker. Possibly because of associations/meaning[ relevance?]

Bamberger: [#EricB297] Investigated prodigies.

Band: [#Tonn79] Bands can be great places to start, as you get support, and more employment from the combined networks.

Baryshnikov: [#VillaDArte] His mother dragged him to lots of ballet when he was little, since he was too small to be left in the house. Also, the communist regime very much stimulated ballet for propaganda purposes.

Basic-object level: [#EricB176] The basic object level (say 'dog') is more accessible to most people than either the superordinate level ('animal') or the subordinate level ('bulldog'). However, experts react as fast on the subordinate level,. {EW: suggesting they have expanded their 'vocabulary'? More nerve fibres leading to 'triceratops', as much (or more) than to 'dinosaur'?}

Batching: [#Ferr102] Doing related things together, (such as handling e-mails in one go), to prevent the time-loss from activity switches.

Bayesian learning: [#EW] We learn things/pay attention to things if they are important and novel/unexpected. Perhaps there is a Chris-effect, where things grow in importance the more you know, which must counteract the greater lack of novelty – or ambition is strong enough? Else most people would become bogged down in one specialism (unproductive) instead of allround generalism.

Bayesian reasoning: [#EW/EricB93] While the human brain seems to use some forms of Bayesian reasoning, humans are not innately very good at at, at least much inferior to computers or expert systems.

BDNF-met: [#http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2011/alcohol-als-zelfmedicatie.html?utm_source=110524-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=alcohol-als-zelfmedicatie&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Makes people more sensitive to stress

Beachhead procedure: [#Weng134] Visiting an imaginary (advanced) civilisation to look at their inventions and scientific discoveries/gain new understanding. Note that you must explicitly say what you are looking for in the beginning, and describe as many details as possible. Bring yourself into the 'inventor's body if possible, to see the world through his/her eyes, and perceive it through his/her senses. {EW may work by activating other stimuli than the knowledge that prevents you finding the right answer?} {and looks like Wenger's 'garden' procedure as well as alpha training}. Can also be used with teams of diverse specialists for the more complex inventions.

Beauty: [#Tonn48] For top modeling, you need great beauty. However, beauty is not enough, you must love the camera, as well as have the discipline of a top sportsperson. Conversely, you can make a career in modeling if you have one nice body part (hair, hands, legs...), or if you're ordinary looking, but still good in front of the camera for normal TV-spots and such. [#NS310115] The experience of mathematical beauty excited the same area in the brain as music and art [EW: Einstein!] Manya Raman Sundstrom mathbeauty.wordpress.com . The role of the aestetic  in mathematical enquiry, Nathalie Sinclair. [#NS020917ThinFemaleModelsChangeBeautyIdeal] Seeing models that are thinner or thicker than your normal ‘ideal’ influences your ideal body size in the same direction.

BecauseISaySo: [#EW/IntelliMagic] Some people, like myself, are not happy with “because I say so”-boss, because it can make us feel unheard, helpless, not taken seriously (and, well, it isn't educational either). At least, there does not seem any reason to prefer a 'BecauseISaySo' boss over an explaining boss. (also lesson for my next job search).

Becher: [#Jaff29] Joachim Becher was a great fantasist (geese growing on trees?) or liar, but he was very enthusiastic. His phlogiston-theory wasn't right, but filled a gaping hole. His father was smart, but died young, and he had a rather unpleasant stepfather. Had a powerful personality (and cheated sometimes?) but didn't handle disappointment well, developed a huge ego. And a even greater ambition. Had charisma, but didn't hesitate to break a contract when it suited him {sociopath?} {?schizophrenia?} {?manic? Narcissistic? He was very charming} Made many enemies with his arrogance. Lots of ideas (most of which led to another bankrupcy). Also was/tried to be economist and inventor. Did read everything he could get his hands on and quoted a lot.

Beethoven: [#Weiner235] Beethoven also loved to walk in the Wienerwald, in the peace and quiet and nature. Is claimed to always have had a picture in his mind when he composed, ‘painting with music.’

Beginner’s mind: [#Catmul221] It is good to continue learning new things (even if it is belly-dancing), to be a beginner, it’s too easy to consider yourself to know everything, ‘know what works’, and makes failure awful. The ‘not know mind’.

Behaviour: [#Franzen298] Behaviour is not only determined by costs and benefits of an action and self-efficacy, but also by what important others in one's environment think of it. And definitely also by the 'accessibility' of an action {EW: does this hamper abstract instructions?} [#http://learnlab.org/uploads/mypslc/publications/b2007b.pdf] State explanations (the situation) seem usually more powerful than trait explanations (personality/preferences of someone) [#NS150912] Influenced by self-interest, short-termism, relative status and social imitation. Self-interest: not only appeals to self, but also to kin work (we are family, mother nature). If environment is safer and more predictable [for men also: finding a mate], future discounting is less. Status: why not competition for the most environmentally aware? [#Hooked26] Behaviours are LIFO; we tend to revert to older behaviours.[#80] If needing to choose, increase ability over motivation. [#NS170514] 30% of victims of child abuse become abusers themselves, as children copy the behaviour of adults.Also for adults: our mirror neurons make us more likely to copy behaviour we see- – for violence it is 30-1000 times more likely even, [#NS050414TheDeathOfIndividuality] Largest single factor driving adoption of new behaviours is the behaviour of peers.

Behaviour Modeling: [#MedskerAcquisitionInterpersonal] Training managers behaviour by lecture methods generally works poorly. Typically only 20% of graduates learned from them about 20% of the desired skills. Behaviour modeling: 80% of graduates uses 80% of the learned skills on the job. First top performers located, their behaviour analyzed, coded into 'critical steps', then video of skilled performer in action, then class discusses what the model did to apply the critical steps, then skill practices, coached prior on how to implement the steps and how to handle contingencies. Afterwards, while discussing, show alternative positive behaviours.

Behavioural change: [#HeaB109] You generally don't change behaviour with information, you do it with emotion (which can be via identity). [#EricsD438] Some theories describe feedback induced behaviour change as the consequence of a discrepancy between the feedback information and some standard {and that's why many clinicians don't improve}

Behavioural goals: [#HeaB62] The most successful changers set behavioural goals.

Behavioural intervention: [#HealthyHabitsHappyHomes] Een studie vond dat zorgen voor geschreven materiaal en telefooncoaching en 4 bezoeken door hulpverleners er wel voor zorgde dat kinderen per nacht drie kwartier meer sliepen, en op weekenddagen een uur minder TV keken, maar het TV kijken on weekdays was unaffected, and BMI decreased only slightly.And TVs were not removed from the children's bedrooms. Having a TV in ones' bedroom makes children watch 1.5 hours of TV more (per day/per week?) than children who don't have it.

Behavioural problems: [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2014/wat-is-de-beste-leeromgeving-voor-kinderen-met-gedragsproblemen.html?utm_source=140114-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=wat-is-de-beste-leeromgeving-voor-kinderen-met-gedragsproblemen&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Kids with behavioural problems don't perform better (or worse) on 'special schools' relative to normal primary schools with a 'backpack'. But the approach needs to be integral, since problems in the family must generally be solved as well to be able to offer the best education.

Behavioural triad: [#EWL260413] Thinking, emotions, actions. Emotions influence both actions and thinking, to change emotions, change thinking (beliefs, plans) and actions, both of which may bring emotions back in line.

Behaviours: [#Colv48] Often recruiting companies don't look at the intelligence of people, but at their character {EW: try change THAT.} But in practice, it's the behaviour that counts, and often you can change your behaviour in particular situations. [#Tigg21] Behaviour is only partially determined by our intentions, for the largest part by our habits, and by the particular situation in which we find ourselves. Repetition makes behaviour automatic. “What will you do, exactly?” is useful for behavioural goals. Exercising new behaviour (instead of old, trained behaviour) is more difficult in stressful or unexpected/uncertain situations. [#Lieb22] You can change someone's behaviour by finding a difference between the behaviour and the self-image/values (showing that his son is induced to stealing too) [#Pink27] Behaviour is not preprogrammed in the brain as a set fixed reflexes (at least not generally in humans), but as complicated if-then-else cascades, which can give rise to unforeseen things such as culture, when the circumstances are suitable.

Being in charge: [#Switch110] Young cancer patients stick with therapy better after playing a game, giving them the feeling that they can do it, that they are in charge.

Belief bias: [#EricB579] People tend to believe material that confirms their opinions, and are much more critical of material that attacks their opinions.

Beliefs: [#EWL] The set of 'truths' or (perceived truths, depression for example) that people base their behaviour on. Having wrong beliefs about a situation leads to wrong actions. [#Dwecix] We may be aware or unaware of our beliefs, but they influence what we desire and how likely we are to get it. [#EW] Children tend to absorb the beliefs of their parents, on how to deal with trouble (eating) or how they are themselves (rotten). [#Ster346] Beliefs such as 'imagination is for children', 'reflection is a waste of time', and 'failure is bad' tend to discourage creativity. [#EW] What you believe about yourself/a situation also influences your mood (and of course, our actions); so if you are in a bad mood it can be wise to investigate which beliefs have caused it. [#NS150510] The more you hear something, the more you tend to believe it to be true. Most beliefs are actually not supported by direct observation but by reading or hearsay, one of the reasons to choose your friends with care, as unsuccessful friends are likely to infect you with their unsuccessful beliefs. [#Pers106] People tend to believe things more strongly if they do not deviate too much from their own beliefs. Probably a higher-emotion belief is also more powerful (Laocoon) [#Lieb141] Believing that someone is smart makes them smarter. [#Lieb23] If people need to defend a belief, their belief in that belief is strengthened. [#Syed159] Top sportsmen like Tiger Woods can be so self-confident, believe so much in themselves, that even the huge self-belief of their competitors can buckle. [#Redirect54] One way to strengthen and develop beliefs is to hang out with people who share those beliefs (EW: also motivation for science? - and EW: as long as you like them) [#Redirect69] College students who believe they can improve their grades by studying harder actually study harder. [#Redirect107] Treatments to prevent child abuse often don't work, because they don't target the critical factor, how parents interpret their child's behaviour. Abusive parents usually blame the child for being difficult, normal parents blame the child's circumstances. Intervention: first ask for problematic cases (when the child was difficult), ask for other possible reasons [preferably until people come up with a changeable reason] and then ask until the parent develops a strategy to deal with that problem. [#NS150613] Stressed people (like rowers for a contest) rate their belief in science higher. Would it indeed be that in times of threat people move closer to their worldview (conservatives becoming more conservative?) [#Flpurish167] Our reactions to adversity stem not from the adversity itself, but our beliefs about it (ABC model). Some deeply held beliefs are called 'icebergs' that can lead to very strong emotional reactions. If iceberg identified, ask questions whether iceberg is still meaningful to them, if it is accurate in the given situation, if it is overly rigid, and if it is useful. Fighting catastrophic beliefs in real time: gathering evidence, using optimism, and putting it in perspective. [#Strien189] Most scientists are unconscious of many of their beliefs and assumptions, some exceptions ('God does not play dice') excepted.

Bell labs: [#Isaacson133] Bell Labs had great scientists, but no entrepreneurial leaders. You need a mixture of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and visionaries. There was a certain interest group that met weekly in the late afternoon, it contained theorists and practitioners.

Belonging: [#Coyl108] Ignition can be about future belonging, believing that the other person does something very worthwhile. {EW: me and Jan Terlouw or Midas Dekkers or such? Or Olaf Budde?} {desire = 'good situation', for example Robinson's musician} [#NSjob] identifying with the people you work with increases both job satisfaction and productivity. [EW IM: hierarchy and learned helplessness, lack of guts and responsibility]

Benevolence: [#NS040513] People signing online petitions may be more likely to give to the charity, but give less, and are less willing to go to protests. Apparently, they seem to feel as if they have 'done enough'

Benign illusions: [#Flourish236] The strength of 'benign illusions' (how you score your mate relative to how your friends score him/her influences the happiness of a marriage (positvely!)

Bereavement: [#NS121209] Bereaved people benefit from the same therapies as depressed people.

Berger, Alex: [#Newport66] Moved from periphery to center of desired industry, aggressively sought feedback and worked on 3 or 4 scripts at the same time.

Bernal: [#Hargit222] Bernal did not win a Nobel prize since he started many things but lacked the single-mindedness and patience to carry them through. Wasted his great talents on futile committees and travels. Was a great encourager though “When Bernal comes to visit me, he makes me feel that my research is really worthwhile”

Bernhard, Claude [#wiki][so not really agreeable]: read?}.

Berzelius: [#Jaffe106] Strength: standardized chemical language, made obscure and varied standard. Also used good mnemonics, letters were better than drawings to remember names. Father had died. Wanted to be a preacher first, but at school discovered love of nature, collecting and hunting birds, insects and flowers. Not very law-abiding, even after prohibition on firearms kept hunting. Bought cheapest chemical book he could find, and begged Afzelius to be able to work in the lab more often than once a week; even was willing to read fat pharacopeia for it. Even bribed amanuensis, and later rented a room where he could do experiments too! Did extremely accurate experiments. Hated when people did not want to publish his work since he was using the new chemical nomenclature of Lavoisier. Quickly learned about the Volta pillar and used it, together with his half-brother. Didn't like Davy's bragging. Visited also other eminent scientists in England. When researching for his book on atoms, encountered work from Richter on atomic masses, and decided to improve upon that, undaunted by its size and difficulties. Taught Woehler. Took lessons from local glassblower, developed and invented new instruments and measurement methods. Didn't take any vacations or hobbies in the months that measuring the atomic weights took [EW: obsessionableness strong] Was enthusiastic about every new discovery. Took ten years in part-time next to his teaching and book-writing. Also liked to set up companies with others, but was no good businessman and needed to work hard to pay of his huge debts incurred that way. Was mostly happy (extraverted) and told funny stories, though could have attacks of headache and did not want to see anyone for days. Wrote a lot (such as his famous 'Jahresberichte'). However, his health deteriorated [EW: chemicals or too-hard-work without relaxation?]

Best possible self-exercise: [#Redirect73] Think about your life in the future, everything has gone as well as it possibly could. Think about what you have achieved, and also about HOW you got there.

Bethe, Hans: [#Crop384] German nuclear physicist, had studied in Munich, Cambridge and Rome. Generous, tactful, pragmatic, far from the rigid authoritarian German prototype. Doctorate with Sommerfeld, postdoc with Fermi.

Better: [#Arde26] Asking people how you could make something better is more likely to evoke something constructive than listening to praise.

Better get busy: [#Coyl127] Primal cue, for example experienced by Michelangelo when walking through Florence, seeing all other people busy with beautiful works. {imitation? Parent-child effect?}

BHAG: [#HeaB74] Big Hairy Audacious Goals “at the end of this school year, you're going to be third graders”. Should “hit you in the gut”

Big Five: [#EW] Would personality not only be shaped by the 'big five' and by habits, but also by habitual thoughts/fears, for example that you're ' not good enough'? What causes narcissism? [#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_structure_of_the_Big_Five] Some people believe in a 'general personality factor' (how well adjusted you are, high pos emo, low neg emo), or in 'alpha and beta' (adjustment to social circumstances (ACNvs self-expression O/E). Some say that each of the 5 can be split in 2 subfactors (volatility/withdrawal, compassion/politeness, industriousness/orderliness, enthusiasm/assertiveness, openness/intellect) Or extraversion=agency (leadership roles) or sociability

Big ideas: [#Medi84] Experts differ from novices in that their knowledge is not a list of facts, but centered around a few big ideas. {salient features? More or less structured mental model?}

Big questions: [#EWL] Technique to make a list of questions you want answered, and studying them (or one of them) before going to bed.

Bildung: [#Bieri] “Bildung” stelt je in staat kritisch te zijn, niet het slachtoffer te worden van demagogen en kwakzalvers. Is ook beseffen dat normen en waarden en gedachten cultureel (mede)bepaald zijn, en daar begrip voor te hebben. “Kan boeken lezen, op zo'n manier dat ze hem/haar veranderen” Kan zich ook in anderen verplaatsen. {EW: maar maatschappij ontmoedigt kritiek te hebben op anderen, zeker inhoudelijke kritiek. Sociaal meekomen wordt gezien als belangrijker dan de waarheid.}

Bilingualism: [#Ster344] Bilingualism may help creativity, but its mechanism is yet unclear. {EW: what if I talked about a problem both in Dutch and in English?} [#Edu] Parents should not talk to their children in a language they do not understand well; better limit themselves to their original language and hope the children learn the country's language at school. First try helping them read and write in their parent's language, then switch to the country's language. [#Hat159] Bilingual education leads to better maths.

Binocular effect: [#EW] Sometimes people don't do something (like pursuing education or practice) because, even though doing it would be rational, things that are far away in the future are 'discounted' in their value.

Biographies and autobiographies: [#RoadExcel1] Biographies and especially autobiographies can be misleading; tales of Gauss' youth are limited to unsupported recollections of Gauss himself as an old man.

Bipolar disorder: [#http://www.c2w.nl/nieuws/hoe-lithium-werkt-bij-bipolaire-stoornissen/item19091] In some cases, lithium works because it dephosphorylates CRMP2  , and CRMP2 strengthens the cytoskeleton (of neurons, amongst others)

BIRGing: [#Robi130] “Basking in reflected glory” - while clubs such as football supporters do have a common passion, they differ from creative teams/tribes because they have nothing or little to do with obtaining the glory in the first place.

Birth order: [#Eyse108] Firstborn males (but not females) have a greater preference for creativity/complexity and risk-taking {EW: this is odd – they have the 'golden position', and would not need to take risks or do anything other than their parents' wishes}. Science Nobel laureates are more likely to be firstborn {or only child} than peace or literature laureates. [#Ster121] Firstborn excel in classical composition or status quo scientists, later-born to creative writers and revolutionary scientists. [#NRC040905] Eldest born get more years of schooling and higher salaries. [#Nett224] Firstborns may have slightly lower agreeableness, though the relation is very weak. [#Strien283] There may be some effect on birth order on acceptance of new theories, but if anything it's only one of many contributing factors, definitely not the sole determinant of rebeliousness.

Birth weight: [#Hatt51] Lower birth weight/preterm birth is not good for school achievement.

Birthday: [#Syed109] The research done on whether students like math more when a role model has the same birthday was performed by Greg Walton and Geoffrey Cohen in 2003 – manipulated students spent 65% more time on the puzzle.

Bissell, Tom: [#NS120610] Writer, was addicted to video games and cocaine (would writers be more sensitive to addictions, perhaps to soothe their overactive amygdala?)

Bittersweet: [#Lyubom208] Making experiences bittersweet (is not going to last) increases happiness and savoring.

Black, James: [#Hargit107] His father used night classes to advance his career [EW: so ambition ran in family]

Blackboard model: [#EricB92] An expert system model that starts its interferences at the most important-looking features of the case.

Blank, Steve: [#Wbruins] Innovation guru.

Blind spot: [#NS050915BlindSpotsWaneIfYouSTareAtCircles] The gap in our visual field is bigger than our blind spot (why? Less data/stimulation of those brain cells?) but it can be reduced by training.

Blinders: [#HeaB97] You can prevent people from getting blinders by forcing them to cite some of their colleagues in each of their presentations.

Blindness/Sightedness: [#SimonB76] Different algorithms and heuristics fall on different places of the blindness/sightedness dimension. As do scientists/artists in those fields in general, including the madness in their families and the kind of environement most conductive to that sort of genius.. [#NS050915GifeTheGiftOfSight-AndInsightWillFollow] Children who see for the first time are not excited, they just see a confusing mess of information, which takes a few weeks to learn to work with – especially motion/change is useful for that, “dynamic information”, which helps integrate information. Suggests that problems integrating information can also lead to autism.

Blocking: [#Kluw6] If A is first associated with C, and later (AB) is taught together with C, the subjects won't associate B with C (unless they had not been trained on A->C first). [#CIAch6] Writer's block can be relieved by taking a break, or by saying out loud what you want to say, as you use different brain areas then.

Blood: [#NS100617FirstTestsOfYouthElixir] Transfusions with plasma of blood of young people results in a falling of carcinoembryonic antigens and cholesterol, possibly also against Alzheimer’s.

Blood sugar: [#McGon34] Blood sugar drops in anticipation of food.

Boas, Franz: [#wiki] German-American {different nationalities!} did PhD in physics, postdoctoral work in geography, was (perhaps naturally) pioneer of the scientific method in cultural anthropology. Jewish, but parents were liberal and educated and hated dogmas. Parents granted Boas freedom to pursue whatever he liked; that were natural sciences. Went to study at Kiel to be closer to his family. Mother founded kindergarten devoted to science. Not really happy with his dissertation, though the problems of perception and earlier exposure to Kant made him interested in psychophysics. Later collaborated with Rudolf Virchow, but was drawn to anthropology by ethnologist Bastian who considered all humans equally mentally capable, explaining differences due to historical accidents. Moved to the States, became editor of Science, also university teacher, however resigned after perceived infringement on academic freedom.

Bochove, Cornelis van: professor of science [beleid] in Leiden. Contact?

Bodily kinesthetic thinking: [#Root03] Seventh of 13 thinking tools, based on sensation of body movement, body tensions, body balance, body posture (in total known as proprioception) “Remember what it feels like to be a piston in an engine”

Body image: [#NS220613] If there are conflicting data on your body, the brain makes a sort of amalgam of them. If a projection of your body pulses in sync with your heartbeat, you put the true position of your body more at another place than when it pulses out-of-sync (so interoception also plays a role).

Bohr, Niels: [#John44] Bohr's thinking was influenced by William James and Kierkegaard. [#Crop242] Founded an institute where physicists from all different countries could work when academic positions were scarce and physicists were poor. Had some luck in hydrogen spectrum prediction (right time!) Interestingly, was not a very good lecturer (not very audible), not a good writer (books repetitious and dense, despite much effort), lacked lots of common knowledge, but had gentle directness and great sincerity, and a forceful and penetrating personality. Could not think creatively however without company. Relentless insistence on clarity, and ability to coax criticism from others. Bohr institute had informal atmosphere, though – pingpong and girl watching and cowboy movies. Started his own career in the lab of Rutherford, international lab under the energetic and inspiring influence of the 'great man'. Had first worked with JJ Thomson, who was more distant and liked critical discussions less. In contrast to Einstein, Bohr preferred to work from empirical facts and find theories to explain them, instead of playing around with maths and fitting the results onto the world. But Bohr was farsighted enough to see the arms race far in advance, and tried to warn (unsuccessfully) Churchill and Roosevelt, who could not understand him. [#JAffe246] Father was scientist, brother a mathematician. [#Hargit136] Went to Rutherford after not hitting it off with Thomson in Cambridge. [#Strien329] Father was professor, member of Danish Academy of Sciences, Niels eldest son. Could often listen at home while father was debating with professorial friends. Niels started co-cognitating with his  younger brother Harald; later with other younger colleagues, sometimes being 'drammerig' to make them contradict him; people who didn't contradict him enough/gave in too easily lost his regards.

Bokma, Pierre: [#Busa90] Actress recommended him to apply for acting school, even though he didn't have any prior interest, though he was annoyed by the low level of acting in a play he once saw. If someone plays well, you are drawn into the story. Thinks he can see genius because geniuses have an air of determination around them; they know what they want and filter out all things that would distract them from their goal. Many 'talents' extinguish after a few years because they cannot bring themselves to the necessary discipline. Though simple hard work is not the right thing; you mainly need proper planning. Can be monomaniac in different disciplines (had some time that he read all bird books), but considers travel, not having to think of anything, as necessity not to exhaust his batteries. Is seldom content, but when he reaches a golden moment, it is great beyond words.

Boltzmann, Ludwig: [#Crop179] Boltzmann was a restless person, moving from one academic post to another, and not only for gains in salary. Had bipolar disorder and a host of other complaints (asthma, migraine, poor eyesight and angina). Traveling/relocating would relieve one depression but not prevent the next. Was a wonderful teacher though, had auxiliary blackboards for side steps, and displayed great enthusiasm for the subject; and open and informal with his students, and sensitive to their needs. Treated students as his peers. Even judged modest achievements with goodwill if they had been made with serious and honest effort. Did not like to be snubbed at though. But was also great and enthusiastic humorist. Was also accomplished pianist. [#Seth121] Published papers and arguments against some of Planck's work on radiation, so kept up with current physics and forced Planck to think more clearly. Though Planck in turn had been quite hostile to Boltzmann's own work as well.

BON: [#Edu] BON is a Dutch society for education reform (Beter Onderwijs Nederland (www.beteronderwijsnederland.nl).

Book flood: [#Nati152] Book flood language courses (students reading books they liked) resulted in greater learning on examinations than traditional classes {EW: so enjoyment was more important than efficiency; but the subjects were 6-12 year old children, they may not have been able to focus their motivation that much}.

Books: [#Watt74] Choose carefully which books to buy or read, and which parts of them. [#NS210407] Intelligent people learn just as well from books, less intelligent people sometimes need a more engaging presentation (for example, TV). [#Bron126] Books can not only teach children what is 'cool' (next to their friends), like 'it's not cool to like your little sister'; but can also teach siblings new ways to be mean to each other. [#http://www.mareonline.nl/archive/2011/09/07/wees-geen-spons] Also read books next to your official study books (often teachers will recommend some), that will motivate you and increase your understanding. [#Hargit123] Herbert Brown got the book 'hydrids of Boron and Silicon' by his wife, it fascinated him, and he went to do research with one of the foremost boron experts in the world. [#Greene103] Books are often full of knowledge, but the knowledge can be abstract and therefore hard to put into practice; mentors can help immensely [EW: and writers don't know everything even they do]

Booster course: [#Syed101] Physicians giving a booster course in heart observation (as many cases in a weekend as usually in a year, with direct feedback) increased their performance very much.

Bootstrapping: [ http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/03/21/catch-22// EW] I guess bootstrapping (women love confident men – confidence comes from success with women is mainly that you go for relatively easy/quick/fast targets first, and build from there.

Borders of intuition: [#EW] There will be a border (based on your experience) where analytical reasoning gives better results than experience/pattern matching.

Bore-out: [#Int261012, ArnoldBakker] Happiness is from achieving things, not from waiting like bored shop personnel.

Boredom: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/radical-teaching/201012/inoculate-against-boredom] The number one reason students give for dropping out is boredom. More specifically, they report that the information is not interesting and not relevant, and they have no personal interactions with teachers. <teachers fail to instill curiosity, fail to take social/material world into account, don't seem to care for students> [DPink64] When you give people a boring task, offer rationale for why the task is necessary, acknowledge that the task is boring, allow people to complete the task in their own way. And carrots may help here. [#NRC?] Does boredom enhance creativity? [#NS200517DaydreamBeliever]  Telling people to focus less hard on a boring task improves performance.

Borstlap, Michiel: [#Busa30] Dutch composer and pianist, mother was pianist, father composer, both loved jazz. Since he was four, he was listening to music intently, was captivated by it. Also loved the vibe with the audience, the applause of the Monty Alexander Trio in Montreux. Practiced 7-8 hours a day, classical and jazz, playing along with records to get his 'chops' going, had very inspiring jazz teacher at conservatory. His father was frustrated composer (not successful, divorced). Michiel didn't want to turn out like him. He thinks that a willingness/courage to let yourself be amazed is important; but a solid basis in technique is needed before you can let yourself go. Discovered fun of playing together at high school, where he was suddenly appreciated when he started to play music. Thinks that great love for a subject is most important, followed by lots of hard work. He sometimes wondered at colleagues who sat in the sun and relaxed: what were their goals in life? {EW: how important it is to excel? More important than momentary comfort?}

Bounded rationality: [#CIA] People cannot be completely rational since the brains do not have unlimited processing capacity {speed and (working) memory?} {EW nor is infinite processing possible in most real-world situations}

Bow: [#SerendipityMeeting] Prof. Ellen van Wolde discussed why the bow at the end of Noah's story was not a rainbow.

Boyden, Ed: [#NS220815GetLucky] Is working on course for serendipity for scientists. One method is having multidisciplinary groups, another is a “tiling tree” that divides all options into “yes” and “no” to create a space-filling tree of all possible options.

Boys: [#http://www.uitzendinggemist.nl/afleveringen/1337700] Always have had 'lawaaidrang', 'actiedrang', 'geldingsdrang' and 'exploratiedrang'. Erg beweeglijk en snel afleidbaar.

Brabander, Ellen de: [#C2W07042007] Unlike classmates who struggled with exercise 3 in an examination and therefore did not have time to look at the easy 4 and 5, Ellen scanned the entire exam and made those first. {EW: metacognition, strategy} Did like research (though hated practica). Did postdoc at group of Nobel laureate. Did not like the competitive atmosphere at MIT, though, and knew that while she loved research, she hated the constant begging for money that a professor had to do. Finds it more important with whom she works than where she works, and takes decisions on her gut instinct. Knows that different people need different ways of supervision.

Bradley, Bill: [#Greene78] Thought of smart exercises to help him master basketball, for example devising eyeglasses made so that he could not see the ball while dribbling.Put all his creative energy in coming up with novel and effective ways of practicing.

Bragg, William Henry: [#Hargit62] Started research in preparation for a lecture, entered a correspondence with Ernest Rutherford, his son learned about X-ray diffraction

Brain: [#Medi65] Except for the big 'roads' of experience-independent and perhaps experience-expectant wiring, everyone has his or her skills/memories in vastly different places in the brain. Maps are established early and are quite stable through life. A small footprint of a critical language area is good: being wide and thin is not good {EW perhaps because it's easier for close neurons to adapt connections? Or would it just result in faster connectivity due to 'shorter cables'?}. [#EricB655] Three characteristics of learning can be seen in the brain: reduced control network activation while motor skill activation remains the same, increased cortical tissue after very long periods of training, and functional reorganization (people learn to use different strategies as training increases, say pattern recognition in stead of analysis). [#Grin59] Carnivores generally have larger brains than herbivores, among herbivores, fruit-eaters have larger brains than leaf-eaters. Animals where fathers contribute to parenting have larger brains, {EW: social animals too?}, animals who live longer have larger brains too. Is this because better food enables larger brains? Or because larger brains are needed to get the food? {Or are larger brains always handy for sexual selection?} Larger brains may mainly allow one to store more things in memory; as IQ is largely independent of knowledge, and therefore may not need as many braincells (relationship IQ and brain size is about 0.3 ? 9%) [#Fors5] The human brain can be approximated by saying that we have a rational/planning brain and a reactive brain, that decides of everything whether it is a snack or a threat. The reactive brain is critical for survival, but since it tends to react on any impulse currently available it is a horrible workmaster. The reactive brain is stronger than the rational brain, but the rational brain can outsmart it. [#Pink8] Our brain generally has lack of information; having to make a good three-dimensional picture out of two-dimensional ones, and yield results independent on the absolute amount of surrounding light {EW: 2 pictures helps, as does experience/knowledge? Though young hares can't have that...} Motivations and morals and perception and action and decision can all be frightfully complex to program correctly and robustly, our brain performs a tour de force every second! The structure of neurons, the presence of neurotransmitters and such does not tell us much about the human mind; after all, neurons are quite the same throughout the animal kingdom, but minds can function drastically differently! {EW: note though that the structure and properties of neurons give some limits and extra abilities on our brain power – you can't really say that you can execute whatever algorithm whatever fast on whatever hardware} [#Foer214] Brains are basically predicting and planning machines; extraneous data, like words, get lost in the data pruning process. [#NS220815SuicideInTheBlood] Giving the brain a wrong pH can also lead to anxiety and panic attacks. [#NS130517LowCannabisDoseMayBoostOldBrains] Older mice given THC perform as well as young mice in navigating a maze or recognizing others. [note that mice lacking endocannabinoid receptors seem to age faster, as the receptors balance out stress] [#NS190817YoungRunnersRememberBetterWhenOld] Young rats which exercise outperform other rats when middle-aged; have better memories.

Brain activity: [#NS090213] Neuronal activity does not have one 'winning' pattern. Mikhail Rabinovich finds that there are usually competing patterns, which seem to compete using the Lotka-Volterra-equations of predator-prey relationships; no thought ever has more than a fleeting supremacy. Equations can describe neuronal activity both for ADHD and obsessive compulsive disorder.

Brain age: [#EW] Could differences in brain age between children of identical chronological age explain why genetics seem to grow more dominant as children reach adulthood? [if speed of development is less determined by genetics than the result of development?]

Brain-machine interaction: [#NS211115MindAdaptsToMachine] fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) can see blood flow to brain, which correlates with how busy one's brain is (so google glass can hold off notifications if you're busy). Or you can ramp up the difficulty if the workload of say novice piano players drops below a certain threshold.

Brainology: [#Dwec222] A module to teach students study skills as well as the growth mindset.

Brainscan: [#NRC211110] About 95% of consumer behaviour is determined by subconscious preferences; people generally don't know why they choose or dislike something [EW: also in dating?] Brain scans (fMRI) can actually predict behaviour better than surveys! The unconscious knows better (or has a greater influence) than the conscious. But eye tracking, EEG, heart rate meter and skin conductivity (sweat) can also say a lot, and are cheaper. EEG good for measuring attention and arousal, but not for determining valence. Victor Lamme. FMRI can measure emotion as well as trust (microsoft has more positive emotion since so familiar, Apple more trust) [#NRC300614SpinnenangstBestrijdJeMetScans; AnnaZilverstandTowardsClinicalApplicationsOffMRINeurofeedback] People get over their fear of spiders faster when they see which technique works best for their brains, but long-term (3 months) there does not seem to be any difference between treatment group and control group.

Brainstorming: [#Eyse239] Brainstorming is better in 'nominal' groups where people don't interact and just their responses are summed! [#Ster140] Brainstorming decreases creativity as the presence of others increases arousal! [#Interm02032012] Brainstorming via MSN messenger generates more ideas than brainstorming via e-mail. Being encouraged to debate, the more critical you are, the the better, also increases quality and quantity of ideas! Groups produce fewer ideas since focusing on what other people say makes your brain less responsive to Eureka moments. Group decision room may be best (show all anonymous responses on a screen, so you have the advantage of good criticism and inspiration for new ideas, while your own ideas are not lost. [#Imagine160] Debating and criticizing each other's ideas generates 25% more ideas during the session, and also lots more ideas individually after the session is over.

Braintrust: [#Catmul] Pixar’s braintrust has two principles: members are experts themselves, they have no mandate. [In general, they also don’t offer a solution, but not sure if there are no exceptions]. Trust & mutual respect are important, but need time to grow. Also important: you != your idea.

Brainwaves: [#NS100710] groups of neurons that get excited, relax, excite again in a certain rhythm, whether alfa, beta, gamma, delta or theta. Helps them ignore irrelevant signals (from another wave). Related items must be on the same brain wave for binding. If neurons are already excited, they can more easily pick up new signals (like a flash of light). Waves that are in sync may be required to bring something in consciousness. In schizophrenia brain waves either don't spread enough, or aren't tightly synchronized with one another. [#NS161113”ReadTheirMindsToNameThatTune] Music makes brainwaves move in tune, but not slower than 2 oscillations per second. 5 per second seems natural, and is also how many syllables per second are processed in speech. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2014/een-fout-brengt-de-hersenen-even-van-slag.html?utm_source=140819-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=een-fout-brengt-de-hersenen-even-van-slag&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Brainwaves after a while start being in sync with music or a task, but decrease in speed when an error is made, the speed decrease increasing as the difference between task rhythm and brain rhythm is greater anyway

Branson, Richard: [#Robi219] Refused to conform to school {high P?}, had two rather unsuccessful business ventures at 15, but decided to become an entrepreneur. He's the founder of Virgin. (school prestations may have been hampered by his dyslexia)

Breadth of attention: [#Ster74] How difficult it is to focus on one stimulus at a time. People with higher breadth of attention are distracted more easily by for example noise, but tend to be more creative.

Breakfast club: [#Persxii] Persaud has a breakfast club with a science editor and a maths and science author.

Breaks: [#Medi88] Give your learners regular breaks – their brains need it to digest information; [#Higbee80] Students learn more from 21-minute lecture when lecture is broken up by three 2-minute pauses.

Brevity: [#White91] Keeping it simple and brief makes the sale {and saves preparation time}

Bribes and threats: [#Csik116] Most adults forget to incite the joy of learning, and try to use bribes or threats to get the youth interested in their subject.

Brick walls: [#Pau] Brick walls (social) are there for keeping the other people out, the people who do not want it enough.

Bright spot-approach: [#HeaB28] Looking for successful efforts worth emulating. Not only provide direction for the rider, but also hope and motivation for the elephant.

Broad education: [#Hargit58] Chargaff saw immediately the consequences (as one of the few scientists) of the base complementarity principle, perhaps because he had a tremendous education in all the foundations of his science and beyond. [#Hargit249] To become a good scientist, a broad-based education helps.

Broad reading: [#EW] Reading multiple sources on one subject can help understanding more than reading one source over and over {though time-optimal method may be reading first source twice; if not understanding then, look for additional sources}.

Broglie, Louis de: [#Crop276] Scientist from noble family(!), was discouraged from science, but fortunately his brother had a fine reputation as experimental physicist next to a more traditional naval career; so role model and protector from family push at the same time. Borther was also good collaborator! Was taken seriously by Einstein, but not by Bohr against whom De Broglie had been pitted in a debate on another topic and lost.

Brugelmann: [#GeoWissen09] “schule verstehen und gestalten”, www.agprim.uni-siegen.de/schuleverstehen

Bruins, Wouter: [#Kick101012] Talks with lots of people, even went to chicken farm to ask what problems they had. Also asks lots of scientists if he can use their lab/equipment, sometimes that even works. Considers many Nobel-prize winners “streetwise”, and don't begrudge others success. Ask Martien Bakker for info over brainstorming. Many scientists don't feel free to investigate what they like; many students never offer suggestions. Seems to have a booklet for ideas. Visits the entirety of the Sylvius, but is friendly and thanks people [and sensitive to their reactions] 3ME Delft- communal whiteboards. Jelmer contact? Why no new Google in LIACS? Tomograph – hadly any transfer of ideas from bar to practice. Perhaps talk to Herman Spaink? Also states that many entrepreneurs could not possibly work at a big company. Not afraid of debts, and gets annoyed by people who don't go for the full 100% for something, or find it immodest to strive for a Nobel Prize. Ambition>fear of failure, so netto result is positive. Scientists say too easily “someone else has already done that” [sort of intellectual one-upmanship, you need to be the smartest]

Buddy: [#NS091113ThePersonalNudge] Giving rewards to a buddy who is supposed to keep tabs of you is twice as effective in changing behaviour as directly getting the reward for the desired performance.

Budgets: [#Greene221] With larger budgets come more constraints, and the need to please many different people; this can make you lose your original vision.

Buit, Lukas: [#Busa135] Encountered squash as 14-year old selected kid for the national bowling league. Knew he had talent as he won from the first man he played against (though he had been hitting tennis balls against a wall for years!) Grew annoyed when teammates didn't do their best to excel (so team sport was not very suitable for him) Didn't do anything on the HAVO though. Set himself the goal (during military training) to become Dutch champion within 3-4 years. Didn't get world champion, since he didn't like leaving for England for that {and he considered himself too untalented for that – fear of failure? Besides he had started rather late, age 15}. Was not very interested in technical precision (more the fitness part). Great desire to excel ehm no, to win, even if he plays poorly. Doesn't like training, likes winning. Father died when Buit was 14. Considers it necessary for a top sporter to be a bastard sometimes. Believes very much in talent.

Bullying: [#Bregma109] Bullying occurs more often in countries with large status differences.

Buoyancy: [#SellHuman120] Ability to keep going when going gets tough. Trick: enumerate (note down all rejections) and embrace (keep those rejections).

Burnouts: [#EW] Some 'prodigies' burn out when they aren't the best anymore. Who do they do so, and how do others survive? [#EricB699] Experts can also burn out if they do too much deliberate practice {EW: would the required willpower produce stress hormones which damage the nervous system, similar to Faraday's memory problems?} {fixed mindset => worth is prestation?} {C2W} People who are passionate about their calling, such as teachers, may have a greater chance to burn out. [#NRC120501] Burn outs are often caused by imbalance between investment in work and its returns. For teachers: not only the uninterested pupil who does not listen to carefully prepared lessons, but also colleagues who do little yet still are accepted; and doing all kinds of extra things but never being offered extra career opportunities. Criticism, especially on their way of teaching, is extra punishing. Reorganisations are also stressful. But many stay because they don't see alternative career options. (Some recommendations were to lessen lesson hours of teachers, and pay for function content instead of years of experience or diploma; Andreee van Es, Commissie Toekomst Leraarschap) [Marissa Mayer] “burnout isn’t caused by working too hard, but by resentment at having to give up what really matters to you.” [#Schmid52] Lack of control, insufficient reward, breakdown in the community, and conflicting values. ?Mismatch between values and jobs?

Burst: [#NRC190610] Most people work in bursts, even Darwin and Einstein when writing letters. Darwin answered most letters within two days, other letters stayed unanswered for months or even years. Because of priorities?

Busato, Vittorio and Harreveld, Frenk van: [#Busa9] Wrote a series for the 6-yearly magazine 'talent'.

Bush, Vannevar: [#http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/bush.html] Engineer who both learned that one also needed to be successful with people, and that one needed to do one's own thing (declined paid PhD-position since he didn't like to be told). Also needed to be a good politician (navy didn't like his invention) [#Crop354] Was plain-spoken and shrewd administrator.

Businesslike: [#Tonn49] You must also take a businesslike look at fame: for a person, some ways to fame are much easier and faster than other ways, depending on looks, skills and personality.

Busyness: [#Greene119] Since boxing coach Futch had so many fighters in his stable, he didn't notice if a teaching strategy didn't work well, he couldn't give much personalized attention.

Byron: [#Isaac10/EW] Lord Byron probably had low agreeableness ('bad'), was heavily in debt (low C?), partly due to addictions (high N?). High N/O, possibly highish E may also have helped (he was very handsome). Was clever enough to seek out solid (and rich) wife for balance, but did not work very long since opposites clashed. May have been gay or bisexual.

C: [#TIE-article] C(conscientousness, five factor model) is negatively associated with intellectual avoidance.

Caffein: [#http://www.intermediair.nl/carriere/werk-en-leven/gezondheid-stress-burnout/waarom-je-juist-geen-schuldgevoel-moet-hebben-tijdens-je-koffiepauze?utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=wk4&utm_campaign=traffic] Caffein, at least in people who seldom use it, will enhance long-term memory.

Cajal, Santiago Ramón y: [#Cajal] Was pretty good teacher, writer (also literary) and had great drawing skills. “Master technique and produce original data, the rest will follow”. Cajal himself did not get advice from teachers or others when devoting himself fanatically to the religion of the laboratory. Did lots of things that didn't work or had been done by others (had not mastered enough literature) Often thought about abandoning work until he had a flash of an idea again. Despised routine and reverence of foreign scholars in Spanish halls. Studied inflammation, was youthful and incomplete, but demonstrated good intentions and love of research. Cajal believes that scientific discoveries are the result of methodical labor, instead of inspiration by God. Indicates importance of having colleagues/friends to encourage and advise one and share one's joy and enthusiasm with. In his experience, most eminent scholars have normal intelligence, though it is refined, and they long for fame. Focuses on observation, experiment, and induction/deduction, finds philosophy lofty but sterile. Our brain was simply built for practical tasks, not necessarily for discovering the ultimate causes of things. Geniuses may have difficulty bowing to rules – they prefer to make them themselves. Thinks a book may be helpful to those with a certain lack of determination or a misdirected effort. Warns against admiring scientists too much, or believing that one is not good enough to tackle certain problems. Arrogance is preferable to diffidence. We often forget the time and effort, patience and perseverance and mishaps before a beautiful theory or result emerges. Would be much better if instructors showed the entire story of the discovery. Rousseau: “There has never been a wise man who hasn't failed to prefer the lie invented by himself to the truth discovered by someone else.” There are always some laws that are based solely on authority, to demonstrate their inaccuracy with new research is always an excellent way to begin scientific work. “Everything of value has already been discovered” -not true. Beware of wanting to easily and quickly find things of value; and know that some fields are more ripe for exploration than others. Fresh talent can always see new possibilities. First start with gathering details that escaped the wise discoverer, and thereby develop a sense of discriminating and such accuracy of observation that it can be used to make discoveries of one's own. “In summary, there are no small problems. Problems that appear small are large problems that are not understood”. Classifies things in understood and poorly understood, as nobody can see their value in the future [EW: yes, but importance?] Advises to not be distracted by secondary concerns like 'usefulness' when choosing a problem. Besides, sometimes a later generation can reap some of the things that you have sown (photography). There are indeed minds unsuited for experimental work, lacking attention span and curiosity. Some people may just learn and understand slowly, or are lazy, or lack patience, thoroughness or determination, which can be solved/developed with some hard work. Diversity in science is good; science needs generals as well as soldiers. Recommends either mastering an experimental method or solving a scientific controversy without reference to current literature to ascertain one's aptitude to scientific work. Reading and thinking about masterpieces allows one to assimilate much of the skill that created them. Forget about unrelated pursuits and the trifles of everyday life. “Saints may emerge from the docile and humble, but rarely scholars”. Independent judgement, bold critical insight important! Cajal does not believe in excessive fondness for tradition. Reading a book twice or three times teaches us its flaws. Don't become a raving admirer of any master -even not your own. One should long enough persist in one problem, so it can yield its secrets. A few weeks of rest may help if still no solution is forthcoming. But don't get disheartened if you are scooped, work on and deepen (Marie Curie was scooped with thorium). Cajal also recommends 'light' hobbies that allow the mind to wander, like walking through nature. “Genius is simply patience carried to the extreme”. Thinks that both devotion to truth and a passion for reputation are important. EW: does he seek a greater good (patriottism, like Faraday sought God) to enhance his motivation? Myself dao – self-actualisation? Our resolve comes not from ideas from the mind, but from emotions in the heart. + Action personalizes us (when we choose an action – motivation? Especially for action for surplus, not lack [EW: girls/women: what if I don't lack a girlfriend, but am willing to actualize a surplus of myself in that way? Time, money and attention?)) + (overcoming) challenge is fun. Scholars (poincare) say that intellectual beauty is what inspires scholars, not the good of humanity. Emphasizes importance of broad education (+physics/chemuistry) for biologists. But also recommens philosophy. Discovery is giving the proper name to something, or to find rule/more general principles. When less was known, it was easier to contribute to different branches. Become a specialist, but don't become shortsighted on a narrow topic and follow the developments in your science and those related to it. When reading literature, recommends paying attention to the research methods used by the author, and problems that remain unsolved. Must fully penetrate the reading, even develop an affection for the author! Avoid abstracts and syllabuses. No inquiry should be started without having all the relevant literature at hand. Complete a thorough review of literature routinely before launching an analytical project. It's still possible to investigate if you can't obtain much literature, be aware that your work will be slower as you will partly rediscover things. Also observe and experiment! Just reading only gives a pale shadow of reality. Himself found seeing a bloodflow so vivid that it may have helped him in his choice for biological research (next to adding much to his book knowledge). Thinks that mastery of analytical techniques is essential, or invention or improvement. Note that difficult techniques have the advantage of having fewer competitors. High resolution methods can often find important results.Scrupulous and repeated consideration of the same data eventually leads to refined analytical sense. Also suggests improvements in methodology. Many methods (like staining agents) are simply found by chance. Still, chance only comes to those who deserve it: only great observers benefit from chance, as they know how to pursue it with enough strength and perseverance, and see its ramifications. Rontgen 'played around' with a novel technique (his rays). Even if a hypothesis is wrong (Becquerel), it can still lead to useful results! Master technique and keep abreast of problems that can be solved. But for a beginner also not bad to follow up on the discovery of others, as the original discoverer almost always leaves things incomplete, bound by tradition him/herself. Choose problems that you understand the methods of, and that you like! (remarks that at his institute people foolishly teach German in general instead of scientific German). Besides, subscribing to a German journal gives much more pleasure in learning German due to its usefulness. Unsuitable scientific types: contemplators (those who love aesthetics, observing nature, without critical thinking, comparing, contrasting, seeking for the unknown and causes), bibliophiles (reading a lot, researching and writing little, danger is to become a phonological record of books), megalomaniacs (planning for the one great discovery, instead of simply plodding on). Must tackle small problems first for encouragement and training. Related: when works are never completed – too big a project! Instrument addicts. Misfits: who see a job as their job, and a hobby (like writing plays) as their true vocation. Theorists: it is fun to make theories, but facts are all that count. “Hypotheses come and go, but data remain”. Hypotheses can be an inspiration, but should not be sought for their own sake. Advises to go work with a scholar abroad as a sanatorium to 'scientific ills' (like theory). How can we go on when there is noone interested in our work? Heroes may not need support, but a country can't depend on the appearance of heroes, we must rely on people with average skills and ordinary talents. Means are virtually nothing while the person is almost everything. Notes though that government grants often went to untalented youngsters with only a talent for intrigue. Advises if you totally lack resources, go to a government laboratory, and through skill (and becoming adequate in efficiency and scientific preparation) become close to the master, then one may be granted a workbench of one's own. But own laboratory is preferable, especially if guidance leaves something to be desired: less interruptions, and let books be your masters. Cajal himself was a lecturer first with limited means, and could make his own laboratory. The development and maturing of talent is more critical than the raw means that one has. EW: is 'barnyard' science as competitive now as it was then? Anyway, seeking to do inexpensive research may be best. Believes that man of science should be married and face pressures and responsibilities of family life courageously. Thinks that being a bachelor continuously distracts a man [parties & wooing & being in love]. Of course, a wife hungry for status and money will cause trouble for a scientific career. Psychological compatibility most important. Ideally intellectual woman, collaborator. Wealthy woman not a good idea, too much into status and partying. Artists can be dominant, and want not only jewels, but books as well! Professional young woman with physical and mental health ideal partner. Discoveries are made by people, not scientific instruments or overflowing libraries. [Most of Spanish best producers were unmarried, especially in biology. Observe: as if you see it for the first time, forgetting what books told you about it. Observe and reflect, come to love them. [love strengthens attention/observation?]. Ideally, for observation, use best instruments and best and most reliable research methods and a variety of methods to compensate for weaknesses in each other. And reproduce before drawing hasty conclusions. Sketching is important as it forces us to observe better. All great observers are skillful at drawing. Ideally have 'model' of results obtained by masters in the technique. Reward is not to him who first discovers something, but to him who first convinces everyone with solid evidence. Almost all great scholars earn their fame by complete mastery of one or more experimental techniques. [Cajal knew people and workers in his field broadly!] Hypotheses ideally also should suggest new research and arguments. You always need hypotheses, otherwise you are an entirely passive observer and note little [EW: also because nothing can be unexpected?] All great investigators are prolific hypothesis generators. To observe without thinking is as dangerous as thinking without observing. General principles: nature uses the same means for equivalent ends: observing something in invertebrates may mean that vertebrates share it. View the problem in its simplest forms. All natural arrangements have a function. Mechanistic versus legalistic: mechanistic: what happens, legalistic: how it relates to greater laws. Avoid excessive attachment to an idea, even if it is yours. “Even though a tumor is ours, it must be removed.” Does not feel slightest embarrasment for giving up ideas (since having the 'helping hand of others' to help him get up after failure would be really embarrassing). Sees it as a way of improving an conquering himself. Besides, none of our tricks and prevent the triumph of truth. “I change because I study” “I change because other study, and I am fortunate to renew myself” “Only fools and those who don't read persist in error”. On writing: 'have something to say. Say it. Stop once it's said. Give the article a suitable title and order of presentation.” Most scholars are too busy to read things they already know, or mere rhetorical exercises. If you do not feel as if you have hit the target squarely in the center, you have left the laboratory too soon. Mention the preceding work of those before you, and be gentle if not very positive. You can't convince your opponents [Shechtman-Pauling], you can only convince the public. If objects are too complex, let schematic or semischematic drawings accompany them. 'whatever is good, if brief is twice as good. One should speak as in a will – fewer words means less litigation'. Write simply and clearly, prevent 'rhetorical flatulence'. Do painstaking biographic research, and better, through consultation with a famous specialist. Sees importance of teaching for a part also to have people defend your priority when you are old and weak. Thinks that young people are motivated by the anticipation of a pleasurable discovery, and by the respect (encouragement?) of the learned. Thinks that teachers should remind students of the joy of wrestling the secrets of the unknown, and by perpetuating one's name through ideas. Though actions are more clear than words for this transfer. Since imitation helps, teacher may want to tell anecdotes from those who distinguished themselves most in the field the student wants to work on. Many prize winners are very egotistical, or just want to become financiers. Many don't reach the top of their field, because they have a weak personality, they are meek and disciplined, and lack initiative. Best students are somewhat headstrong, contemptuous of first place prizes, and immune to the inducements of vanity. Advantages: scorn material gain and high academic rank, and minds are captivated by lofty ideals [EW: ideals stronger than seductions of the senses]. Can appear in the laboratory for technical advice and a problem to work on. Still, may not live up to their potential, not being able to focus enough. Ostwald: ideal student wants more, and focuses on originality. But teacher can only recognize them by being friendly with them, and treating them like colleagues in the lab. Still, may lack perseverance and discipline. Or is overly timid. Rigid worship of truth, sound an genuine scepticism, ambitious but with noble and worthy goals. Enjoys laboratory work and has boundless energy, ideally has own laboratory as well, with money and time stolen from recreation and amusement. “True vocation always consists of a special activity for which the young man sacrifices time and money, scorning the distractions of our age.” But vocation does not imply aptitude, nor does aptitide guarantee success. Untiring reader. Master should guide pupil in literature searches. Should first suggest a topic well in the other's grasp. Masters should always deliver justice to the students in his book and monographs. And preferably not add their names to the student's first paper. Cajal dislikes scholars who use students as workhorses, eager for honors and awards for themselves. And forsake teaching before you become to old to do research yourself, you can still then write about the history and philosophy of science.

Calatrava, Santiago: [#Greene220] Loved to draw as a child, and was constantly sketching. Since projects could last years and therefore became boring, decided to adopt an attitude of constant dissatisfaction. If what he was designing started to feel dead in any way, he started all over again. So find something between enjoying the slow cooking to make things better, and the tight deadlines that help you concentrate...

Campbell, Donald: [#Strien124] Was a very successful psychologist, especially since he excelled in clever design of experiments. Told his students that he would be able to paper his room by all the never completed and rejected papers he had produced.

Candor: [#Catmul] Important in braintrust meetings [different from honesty]

Candy: [#Peal50] Eating candy when you feel stressed can prevent relapsing into worse habits like smoking or drinking or gaming... <EW: glucose?>

Cannizaro: [#Jaffe124] Was like a crusader; had studied medicine, then chemistry, in Pisa and in Naples, had been fighting also in the revolution in Sicily, but had to flee to France after it failed. Worked in the lab of the quite-good French chemist Chevreul. Loved teaching and giving lectures, also about citizenship and operas. Was a very good public speaker [which nevertheless did not help him on the chemical congress]. Nevertheless, distributed copies of a long letter he'd written before, and at least one young chemist was so impressed that he passed the message on in his own books. {one of the problems was that chemists, including Dalton, did not clearly distinguish between atoms and molecules and used the terms inconsistently}

Career: [#Sikkel] People can change careers either because they want more money and follow another education, or because they don't like/are not inspired by their current job (such as sales). Making something tangible (like bread, or a wall), or interacting with people/animals (masseuse/dog trainer/teacher/establishing an orphanage) seem especially attractive, though some people just wind up in something because a friend offered them the job. Also dislike-factors that give problems, such as stress and/or not being able to do what one loves (being creative). Boredom can also play a role, of performing the same routines for too long. Or are bored, but due to their contacts, discover something they like much more (Frans Ottenhoff), or things are fine until the boss changes. Or they miss the fun/laughter in their jobs. Push factors: stress, 'deja vu', don't care, bad boss, slow changes in job, bad pay/lack of prospects; pull factors: meeting with friend, inspiration due to coincidence (orphans), 'sticky' hobby. And often, when there is a hole (like a burnout) something will come to fill it (relative advantage?) [#IntRutgerKappeDeterminantsOfSuccess] Extraversion gives a higher starting salary, after a few years, intelligence and a pragmatical character determine career success. [#NS261013] Western countries have the 'demographic transition', where striving for status leaves families with fewer children. Having children (for women) depends on support: having closer contacts with extended families increases their chance to fall pregnant, having a dearth of eligible partners also makes women prioritize briefcases over babies. [#Seth22] German Technical Universities were once a place where young 'real scientists' could have a job waiting for a position at a 'real university', but that threatened to diminish when the technical universities sought more practical-minded teachers.

Career choice: [#ArnoHermans] That few Dutch children become engineers at least appears not to be the fault of the parents, who tend to see engineering as a solid job choice with high guarantee of job and relevant work, even if it offers less status and less pay. [Emphasis EW] Hermans points the finger at young people who are going to study what they like, and that institutions do not work hard enough to show how fun engineering os.

Career interest: [#Feist72] Congruence between talent, performance, self-perception and drive is the best predictor of career interest.

caress: [#NS211017ComfortingCaress] Women who have been excluded in a social game feel better afterwards if they have been slowly touched with a soft-bristled brush (than if the touch was fast).

Carnot, Sadi: [#Crop43] Carnot's youth was a political and military tumultous time in France. Father was Lazare Carnot, who not only excelled in politics, warfare and logistics (but was certainly not a sycophant, chose not to help Napoleon), but also quite a good scientist and engineer, whose ideas inspired Sadi in his approaches to study the theoretics behind machinery. His publication missed its audience: not mathemathical enough for scientists, not down-to-earth enough for engineers. Also was shy and reserved and wary of publicity of any kind, which didn't help put his publication to the fore. But also investigated a cholera epidemic (poly-curious?). Seemed to be independent and courageous. Did not have direct contact with the great French contemporary scientists, but did study at the ecole, and so probably had a decent environment for inspiration.

Carroll, John: [#EricB78] Educational psychologist who said that aptitude is just how fast one learns something, not a limit on what one can learn. Distinguished time required for learning (aptitude), time willing to spend on learning (perseverance) and time allowed for learning (opportunity).

Case-based reasoning: [#EricB92] A base model for an expert system, case-based reasoning compares a situation with all situations in its database to give a conclusion.

Casting: [#Tonn72] Casting bureaus can help you get famous, but you need to show that you're passionate about what you do, and preferably have as much experience as possible, even on amateur levels. And remember that even a small role can be the start of something big.

Cat theory: [#Myst35] Cats lose interest if getting something is too easy or too difficult. People (and women) are basically the same; keep the bait just out of range and then entice them in small increments.

Catchphrases: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/201108/parenting-four-sure-fire-ways-send-messages-your-children] It can be helpful to phrase core messages in short, memorable ('made to stick') ways.

Categories: [#Sommers224] Categorization (of, for example, people) is a neat way to save on mental energy. Note though that it exaggerates small differences between groups and lets us underestimate big differences within them. We also expect worse behaviour from people in other groups. We process in-group faces holistically, noting both the features in isolation and the relationship between those features. Out-group faces are not warranted that much attention.

Cathexis: [#Flourish230] Some things are more easily learned. Easy learning, resistance to extinction, and irrationality. [So for motives as well?]

Caudate nucleus: [#NS260817The man who reads dog minds and personalities in a brain scanner] Dogs showing higher activity in the caudate nucleus [anticipation of something important] whoever gives the hand signals were better suited for service dogs, dogs that showed increased activity in the amygdala failed.

Cavendish: [#Jaff58] Was independent-minded, did not adhere to religion or traditions of the university. Was very accurate and disliked ambiguity. Had only one suit of clothes, outmoded at that, and found it hard to look others in the eye, had extremely fixed habits {autism seems quite accurate here} Read a lot about the discoveries of others (Musschenbroek, Franklin, Beccharia, Warltire, and many others), and listened attentively at the meetings of the Royal society (father had also made an invention). Paid barely any attention to nature or art, just to measurements. Did not concern himself with scientific debates [time?] Had no hunger for honour, nor was jealous. Was very accurate, and hated errors and half-truths. Did not publish prematurely, wanted to be certain of his finds. Always took the same route, a 'slave to habits'. Loved the search, not finding useful things. Had at least as much perseverance as Boerhaave, who had heated an open vessel of mercury for 15 years. Small oversight though for priority that he told Priestley about his experiments before publishing on it. Also shy, not very comfortable with large groups of people. Also was a practitioner of astronomy. Was very good at measurements and combined sharp observation with persistence to solve mysteries (why the water after air/hydrogen burning was acid). Loved measurements more than the beauty of nature.

Celebrities: [#Pers354] In general, the lower the religiousness of persons, the higher their celebrity-worship. People seldom believe that celebrities can do evil acts, and generally worship them as saints, sometimes even following their leads in suicide and showing bereavement symptoms at a loss – just as if the celebrity was really close. <Obama's dog>

Censorship: [#Strien208] Scientists are usually subject to self-censorship, censorship by religious or political authorities, or censorship by the media, which can ignore or vehemently attack  'non-pleasing' viewpoints.

Censure: [#EW/Howe] If children feel that their work is under close scrutinity of adults, they feel cramped and less creative; the work becomes less enjoyable to them (hence the miniature books of the Brontës) [#Colv192] Just being watched is detrimental, as is being offered a reward. {reward/punishment making people risk-avoiding and conservative?}

Center of attention: [#Scho26] The subject you need to concentrate on should be in the center of your attention, have a high emotional value for you.

Central message: [#Simo179] Not only originality counts, but also how much a creator makes the idea his central message and devotes energy to emphasizing and communicating it – evolution was much more Darwin's “central message” than Wallace's, while another idea of Darwin was attributed to others who emphasized it much more instead of making it a sidenote in their vast work.

Centrum begaafdheidsonderzoek (Nijmegen): investigate!

CEO-disease: [#Dwec20] Repeating past strategies that proved successful then, even while they are not appropriate any more. Caused by fixed mindset?

Cerebellum: [#Kluw20] The cerebellum seems to play a role in senso-motor skill acquisition, but not in normal 'declarative' learning.

Certainty: [#Wolt63] The certainty with which persons remember things has some correlation to the accuracy, but not fully. In practice, certainty is for a large part also produced by the number of details remembered. [#Nass67] Certainty/uncertainty seems to correlate to dominant/submissive personality type, 'submissives' preferring people who express uncertainty. [#Seth129] Some scientists can believe much more in their findings than would be realistic, for example Planck's beliefs in the 'absolute'

Chadwick, James: [#Hargit137] More approachable than Rutherford, who was open for questions but seldom said what a student wanted him to say; Chadwick's thinking was easier to understand.

Challenge: Used in school to get children/students active, but also appreciated by adults. Challenge is something that both is not trivial and is fun/rewarding to do. If something is not fun/ rewarding, it would merely be called difficult. Part of the “fun” of the challenge is tension resolution: the question “can I do it?” can either be confirmed or denied. Something that is easy or trivial does not produce such suspense or tension: the answer (yes) is known beforehand. Biologically, challenges can be productive when greater achievement yields greater reward, showing the person involved as fit indeed. However, too high (or too low) estimation of one's own abilities can change a challenge into a seemingly trivial task (avoided) or something impossible (hopeless). [#Hargit103] Most Nobel-prize winners were in their childhood or early-to-mid-career exposed to severe challenges. Loss of job of parents, loss of father, poverty, migration. Cram claimed that his early years taught him how to cope with adversity and stress, to respond positively to challenge, to be self-reliant, self-determining and individualistic. Thinks that modern youth is handicapped by encountering adversity only later in life. [#Hargit119] Having to work hard at Berkeley (instead of in Germany where he studied before) encouraged him.[#Ster72] A medium level of challenge/difficulty produces the most creative results.

Challenges: [#Dwec/EW] Some people relish challenges more than others. But would not even growth-mindset people have a despair zone outside their challenge zone and comfort zone? {may depend on their interpretation of failure} [#Gall120] Would challenge be a better motivation for sports than 'winning?' [#Robi56] A young mathematician challenged himself continually to improve his calculation speed. [#Csik80] Adults seem to prefer relaxing situations with low challenge, even if they feel better when the challenge is higher.  [#Schmid219] Big challenges attract big talent. Stickiest work environment have opportunity and empowerment. Cutting-edge work with the best tools for the best customers is important. [EW: so if you try the reverse]

Challenging: [#Hatt9] Expert teachers are more likely to set challenging than 'do your best' goals,, invite students to engage rather than copy, and aim to encourage students to share commitment to these challenging goals. Let students engage in challenging task a greater part of the time.

Chamberlain, Owen: [#Hargit158] Worked at Los Alamos, and had lots of contacts there with Oppenheimer, Segre and Fermi; once shared a train ride of 1.5 day with Fermi and had him at his disposal, answering all his questions about physics.

Champollion, Jean-Francois: [#Greene238] Great interest in historical civilizations. Wanted to discover new things about origins of mankind, and learned Greek, Latin and Hebrew by age 12. Inspired at age 12 by finding of Rosetta stone. Found monks who spoke Coptic. (Contrast to Dr. Thomas Young, who also wanted to crack the mystery, but was not that interested in languages, and his mathematical approach did not work that well. Young liked the idea of fame, solving the puzzle; Champollion wanted to understand)

Chance: [#Ster328] Chance encounters with mentors are much more likely where the field has a high density.

Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan: [#Crop438] Worked in phases of 10-15 years: selecting a subject, studying everything available on the subject, own research and scientific papers, and finally writing the book on the subject. Didn't care much about the field thereafter, did not prefer to pick up the crumbs left behind. Born in India, but moved to England and later America for good graduate training and career prospects. Excellent theorist, teacher, mathematician, research advisor, editor, science historian, and storyteller. Was however not pushy or 'careerist'. Deep education, knowledge of world literature. Considered the scholar's challenge to develop a perspective on a field, a view of one's own. Father was authoritarian, aloof from his children, but highly cultivated and travelled. Chandra was oldest son. Mother had little formal education, but translated Ibsen, and protected Chandra from his father's wrath at career choice – strong-willed woman. Original choice was mathematics (role model Ramanujan). Father insisted on physics, as his brother C.V. Raman had been very successful there. Raman also a role model for Chandra. At age 18, went to see visiting physicist Sommerfeld in hotel in Madras, who told him that everything in physics was changed since his last book, but gave him some proofs of his paper on statistical mechanics. Chandra grasped the concept, worked out his own application for it, and sent the paper to Fowler in Cambridge (had seen Fowler's work in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society). Fowler suggested some changes, and it was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. Got offers for scholarships, Chandra doubted because his mother's health was declining, but she herself decided he should go. Chandra thought about physics on passage to England, and was discouraged by the red tape but persisted, and a personal letter from Fowler helped. Found himself surrounded by Dirac, Fowler and Eddington. Dirac seemed most distant, but actually became a good mentor and friend. Also visited Bohr's and Born's institutes, made quite some friends there. Tried write a paper on theoretical physics, but was discouraged when Dirac pointed out an error in it, and returned to astrophysics. After getting PhD contemplated staying at Oxford for a while with another friend and mentor, Edward Milne. Eddington took an interest in Chandra's work on the exact theory of white dwarfs, and even got him a calculator. But he turned on Chandrasekhar's theory in public, and no prominent physicist dared say in public that Chandra was right. But being forced to turn to a new subject, he discovered that he was intellectually suited for scientific cycles. Was offered a job by Raman, but Chandra was wary as he admired Raman as a physicist, but disliked his personal style of sensationalism and controversy-stirring. After lectures in America, was offered two positions, Chandra took the one at the Yerkes observatory, which was more prominent. Developed a curriculum with Gerard Kuiper. Chandra loved to give lectures, and was very demanding of his students. Admired Gandhi. Note that Eddington supported Chandra's election as FRS. First wanted to go to Princeton, but Chicago head stopped him by appealing to Chandra's morality – as long as Chicago did not fail him... But when Chandra criticized the Yerkes director he found out that moving to the Chicago university proper was preferable, also with the silver lining that he could then work with Fermi and the other greats of physics. Became editor of astrophysical journal, which he regretted later, as he wanted to be fair but thereby isolated himself by not going to symposia. Chandra was also great mathematician (like Newton; even Einstein was not so good) 'he talked to these equations personally'. Used Roger Penrose as consultant to clear up mathematical questions. Chandra's final study was of Isaac Newton. Had dark outlook; separated from native culture, regularly working 13 hours a day.

Change: [#Gall75] It is often best not to start changing the thing you deem worst, but the thing you want to change most. [#Bron160] 'Great' behavioral programs change the behaviour of about 15% of people; good ones of 4%. Apparently, changing behaviour is really hard. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/radical-teaching/201005/want-children-pay-attention-make-their-brains-curious] Apparently things that change, and especially things that are threatening, pass with priority through the Reticular Activating System into consciousness and the emotional centers. [#Franzen319] If you want to change someone else's behaviour, it's important that you're seen as likeable and reliable by the other. [#Sommers112] Find ally in dissent, and, especially if you're a minority, stick to your guns, you can't afford hesitation and vaccilation. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2014/onderwijsvernieuwing-hoe-het-kan.html?utm_source=140520-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=onderwijsvernieuwing-hoe-het-kan&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Change needs to 'pay itself' back (in time and effort spent at it). Teachers can change best by a combination of modularity (see how they can adjust their current 'building blocks' into the structure of the new programme) and by remembering their success experiences for motivation. {Michiel Dam} [#NS150314] “InSicknessAndInhealth” - visualizing consequences (manipulating an aged avatar of yourself) has much more motivational impact than just hearing about risks and benefits. [#McGraw] To change your life, you need focus, tools and knowledge [EW: and motivation and resources like time]. Claims that winners have a plan instead of being merely reactive [=lack of focus]

Changing reality: [#Strien212] Sociological and psychological research may have as consequence that people start thinking differently about themselves, changing the subject (often leading to a greater number of people having the described problem). Though even unscientific labels can have large effects on human life, especially if they sneak into someone's identity.

Changing standards: [#EricB466] In music, as in sports, standards of excellence are advancing.

Chaos: [#EW/Laird] What if the brain is not a regular Turing machine, but a 'chaotic Turing machine', where any of the many inputs in the environment or even random noise can make the result unpredictable? (or harder to predict, though expertise can be quite consistent]

Character: [#Root] Promising young scientists seem headstrong, not caring about first place or vanity {ambition level? Or does wanting to please people distract you from being creative?}, have restless imagination and spend much time on arts, literature and physical activities. {or would social scientists be more competitive} {And what environments produce such persons?} [#Int210111] Character influences career direction and success more than education; extraverts earn more money, and neurotics are unhappier compared to others. [Bart Willie- U Gent]. [#http://faculty.washington.edu/janegf/goalsetting.html] Character influences on achievement (like achievement orientation and conscientousness) mainly seem to work through/correlate with self-set goals. [#Strien111] In scientists: perseverance, curiosity, verwondering and ambition. [#Stalla124] Can be developed by developing high-trustr relationships with honest, wise, caring and candid advisors. Or start a club with friends...

Chargaff, Erwin: [#Hargit59] Had very broad and deep knowledge, however was shy, avoided company of his 'betters', was tentantive and fled social contacts, which led his discoveries to be less remarked.

Charisma: [#NS230612] It is unclear what causes charisma: social competence + positive self image? Internal contradictions? Emotional expressiveness, enthusiasm, eloquence, self-confidence, vision, and responsiveness to others.But things must not be too much (Robin Williams having too much emotional expressiveness). Responsiveness to opportunity? Risk-taking? Unconventionality? Mimicry, more activity, more consistency and fluidity in speech.

Cheating: [#http://www.shoppingblog.com/blog/7061130] Teachers and principals in schools can cheat if they feel pressured by standardized tests. [https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3459] Cheating can be diminished by shifting responsibility to the student via honour codes.

Cheats: [#NS080511] People are much better at formulating a rule for filtering cheats when alerted to possible cheats; {EW: apparently motivation makes people think more? Economy of thought?}

Checking: [#Watt250] At the beginning of the lesson, it can be useful to check if the students have retained the previous lesson {EW: also in self-study?}

Checklists: [#StolB75] Checklists may seem overly compulsive, but in most situations they are not. [#Gawan62] In building, for every new building a new checklist is made, by representatives of the 16 trades in collaboration. Then it is sent to the subcontractors and independent experts to make sure that everything is correct and nothing has been missed. There are also checklists for communication tasks, submittal schedules, to ensure that experts talk to one another on a regular basis. Who talks with whom about what before which date, who has to submit pieces of information before the next step can proceed. This gives a buffer for the unexpected and unforeseen, to nip things that can go wrong in the bud. So checklists serve two purposes: to ensure that the stupid yet critical stuff gets done, and to ensure that the right people talk to each other at the right time (while people are still given the freedom to handle the nuances in their expertise area themselves). Dangers: can be too long, too hard to use, too impractical. Good ones are precise, efficient, to the point, and easy to handle even during difficult situations. Do not spell out everything, just remind people of the most critical and important steps. [EW: also prevent memory/judgment blackout during stress?] For checklists, you need a clear pause point (=activation trigger: when is the checklist going to be used?], or with DO-CONFIRM (everyone does something, confirms and pauses), or READ-DO (recipe-like). Most important are 'killer items', items which are both critical and are often overlooked. Checklists themselves need also be checked and refined, for example in simulators. If a list needs to be shorter, eliminate those items that are relatively rare, are no 'killer items', have lower effects, are relatively time-costly for their benefit, or don't get neglected a lot. [so something like: prior chance that it will go wrong x impact / time-cost] Tend to increase up-front time, but may cut time overall, either by reducing the pondering time when people are uncertain what to do next or by preventing complications.

Checkov-effect: [#BramvandenBergh] If you stretch your arm, you are more likely to think about the future impact of choices, if you bend it you are more likely to take something (so shopping basket in supermarkets inspire you to buy more candy)

Cheetahs: [#Who161] Lambs are CEOs with lots of soft skills, good listeners, treat people with respect, feed on direction and feedback of others. 57% success chance. Cheetah's: CEOs who moved quickly, acted aggressively, worked hard, were persistent, set high standards and held people accountable for them – 100% succes chance.

Chess: [#EricB171] Chess experts have about as many blunders and poor moves in regulation games as class-C players, but lose much less quality during Blitz games (suggesting they see the best solution much faster) [#EricB534] Rating is explained by serious study alone (hours of?), size of chess library, and current age (as negative predictor; either by deterioration of mental facilities or by having less focused practice if the number of hours studied has been controlled for). [#Foer64] Experts see chessboards as chunks of pieces, and systems of tension. Also, when playing chess, experts engage the frontal and parietal lobe, which means they're retrieving information from memory; lower-ranked players use the median temporal lobes, so they're encoding new information. [#Foer63] Grandmasters don't seem to have any measurable cognitive advantage.

Chewing: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201010/the-superpowers-candy] Chewing gum can improve your mood, reduce stress, increase your mental focus, and block pain. Who knew a stick of Juicy Fruit could do so much? But several studies suggest the act of repetitive chewing shifts the state of your brain in many helpful ways. Areas related to attention and self-control become more active, while areas related to stress and pain processing become less active. Chewing gum also seems to increase serotonin levels, may explain why chomping boosts mood. [#Intermed181111] Chewing also boosts memory 23-36%, increasing the activity in the hippocampus. [#Erard236] Boost learning 24-36%. Though levodopa may also help with like 20%

Chi: [#EricB305] Researcher of expertise in physics.

Chiechanover, Aaron: [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368_supp/full/478S4a.html] Nobel prize winner, discoverer ubiquitin system. Advice to young scientists: Choose a good mentor who asks original questions. Be patient, do not give up: work hard and persevere. Be passionate and excited about what you are doing: think of your scientific profession as if it were your hobby. Luck is important too, but remember, very often luck is not blind: it hits those who are ready. Ciechanover pushed the student researchers to think about implementation — to consider potential side effects or other problems that might undermine a promising idea. He pointed out that many strategies have already been worked out for overcoming hurdles in drug development, and suggested that young researchers would be well-advised to keep abreast of the approaches that have succeeded in the past. {EW: showed very broad and deep knowledge, knew for example recent drug developments, and that promotors were shut down fast by methylation}

Child abuse: [#NRC061211] Abused children have less grey matter in their brain. Physical and emotional child abuse have different consequences; emotional child abuse leads to a smaller cerebellum.

Child-centered: [#Bloo471] The families of the musicians and athletes were very child-centered; the mothers seldom hired babysitters, and the family spent lots of time together with shared activities. {children in competition with each other? Funnel interests in clear performance/winning. May promote conformity-interdependence. And sculptors?} {also, child-centered seems to contrast with the neurologists, who had largely absentee parents}

Child-rearing: [#NS24032012] Animals raised by humans outperform those reared by their mothers.

Childhood: [#Strien281] Creative people are often raised with special care and overprotection and being placed high demands on.

Childhood illness: [#Hargit107] Nikolai Semenov (C56) could not go to school due to typhus so turned to books.

Children: [#NS261013] Extrovert men, agreeable women have more children than average, conscientous women and people scoring high on openness to experience have less.[#Zill116] Watching people talk has very little interest for young children. [#Zill136] Age and gender are the most important factors for explaining TV preferences of children (and perhaps interests in general?) There seems to be an innate need for children to find order, structure and predictability in their environment. Children have limited information-processing capabilities (EW?) and at least lots less knowledge than adults, they need to be presented information more slowly. They much prefer things they can understand or almost understand over things that are too complex (or simple). Also prefer familiar contexts and visuals, such as babies, young children (and non-threatening monsters, such as the muppets?). Begin liking more fast-paced, complex programs with less 'friendly' characters around age 5-6. [EW: less friendly characters are stressful for young children?] Young children also think that everything on television is real, up to Bugs Bunny. Seeing those characters as real may also make them more interesting than 'acknowledged fiction'. Children also judge more by looks than by behaviour. Also can only concentrate on one prominent feature, disregarding less obvious details. Children pay attention to rhythm, rhymes, music and songs. In middle childhood (8-12 years) children start to pay more attention to the real world around them and start to like realism in shows more, as well as having real role models, such as sport stars. Also role-taking growth; children gradually learn to understand that others have thoughts and feelings too, and start identifying themselves less with those who are physically similar to them, but those who are more similar in character or social situation. Pay more attention to same-gender characters, and dislike viewing those younger than themselves. Though can like to watch dissimilar characters (such as superheroes), as individuals to emulate, 'wishful identification'. Preferences up to 2 years old indistinguishable between boys and girls, but thereafter grows. Interestingly, boys focus on male characters, girls on characters of both genders (more male characters, and more interesting roles for males). Girls are less interested than boys in devices, but relationships, story lines, realism. Scary programs are for a part interesting due to their information, but for a large part also because they tend to be action-packed. Children are relatively high in sensation-seeking.

Chinese: [#EW] Would exclusively studying for school in adolescence diminish the polymathy effect that would create great Chinese scientists?

Choices: [#EW] Would having too many choices/inputs/impulses result in students paying less attention to the most important task (study)? [#Whit44] Lack of choice is always demotivating. [#Ferr192] Having too much choice can paralyze buyers. [#Gold28] A wide selection is only good if people know exactly what they want (and it is very particular) or enjoy the process of choosing. Most people hate going through the trouble of choosing between many varieties. [#NS050507] Having someone else choose can help, especially if the options are both unpleasant, as when you choose you will feel worse afterwards. [#NRC030311] Speed daters choose less often when the candidates are more varied, and then also disagree more about the most attractive other person.[#Franzen264] People often make choices based on their distance to the reference group, especially relative wealth/possessions. [#White39] Important question: Can I look myself into the eyes if I haven't tried it? [#SellHuman136] Adding a dictionary to a software package made less people choose it {because it burdened their working memory? Or because including the dictionary made the software package seem cheaper/worse?} [#SellHuman182] In sequential presentations, best for incumbent to go first, best for challenger to be last. [#Newport165] At different points in your career, different directions can seem compelling; it's hard to make your choices 10 years ahead. [#NS140412] If a meal tasted bad, people enjoyed it more if a friend had chosen it for them than if they themselves had chosen it. [#Renwick175] Even trivial choices lead to increases in intrinsic motivation, levels of learning, and perceived competence. [#SimoneKeijsers1201114] If you list the advantages and disadvantages of any choice (weighted in a scale of 0..10) but one choice has very few advantages/disadvantages, you need to learn more about that choice.

Chunk up/chunk down: [#More21] Going up or down in the hierarchy of skills.Getting to the right level to practice (not too complex, nor too simple) is called 'isolation'.

Chunking: [#Watt164] The more we learn about a subject, the greater our 'chunks' of memory become and the faster we can interpret a situation. {salient factors and stronger links between X and Y} [#Coyl80] Chunking can be learned by first observing the whole, breaking down the skill in its component pieces (and practicing those), and practicing slowly. [#EricB49] With chunking, one seems to expand ones 'vocabulary'. Working memory remains the same (amount of chunks stored in it remains similar), but chunks are bigger – though experts use long-term working memory too, so that may be a better explanation {!?}.

Chunks: [#EW/Haring] People may learn well from absorbing bite-sized ideas from books or youtube-videos. Sometimes those remain unconnected in memory, a bit like dormant viruses (like Bas Haring's memories of me) waiting to be connected at a later date.

Cindy Crawford effect: [#EW] Demotivation that occurs when comparing oneself to an unrealistic ideal “Even I don't look like Cindy Crawford in the morning”. <see also “Inspiration”>

Cingulate cortex: [#Kluw60] The cingulate cortex is involved in sensations of pain, as well as in all tasks requiring attention. [#Nelissen184] Front part is for feelings (including pain) + autonomous reactions (goosebumps, faster heart rate), also for recognizing emotions of others.

Circumstances: [#EW] Regarding the dictum that people only do something if it brings them advantage, it may be that being born poor or relatively poor, losing one parent or such stimulates ones ambition. However, since most people are just crushed by disadvantageous circumstances, the few that rise either have extraordinary ability, willpower, faith in themselves, or a supportive environment (at least one person who believes in them). They must have the hope that their actions bring them what they desire (so not be discouraged too much in the start). The rich seldom start splendid careers in science {or because there are so few rich? Or may they be pressured to go into politics?} (though Cavendish and Oppenheimer may be instructive exceptions). {beliefs versus distractions}

Citation scores: [#Ioannidis, FASEB] Universities are almost never led by scientists with high citation scores; only 2 of 200 top life scientists ever did such a thing [#Hargit199] Among the top 50 mostly cited chemists are only 9 Nobel laureates. It would seem that Nobel Laureates publish fewer papers, but more highly cited ones than the top authors. Part may be 'obliteration by incorporation' -some famous discoveries are not cited anymore as they are so well-known.

Citing: [#NRC] Gregory Webster, Univ of Florida, discovered that researchers who cite a lot are cited more as well.

CITO: [#Bartels, twin research Vol 5 p 544] Correlation between CITO and IQ at age 5, 7, 10 and 12 are 0.41, .50, .60 and .63. 60% in total seems to be genetic.

City life: [#NRC230611] The longer people have lived in a big city as youngsters, the worse the coupling between amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, and the more the ACC is activated with social stress. 21% higher chance on anxiety disorder, 39% higher chance of depression. [#Lehrer] Cities make people more creative [#EW; is that increased creativity only due to combinatorial effects or also linked to the increase of schizophrenia in city dwellers?]

City size: [#Colv202] Being born in a smaller city may be an advantage, as your talent has much less competition, it's easier to stand out, and you may have much more self-confidence when you finally meet people at your level (or you may burn out, like the chess prodigies and Chinese students) {so you may be more motivated to practice. Anyway, the initial failures should be taken with some grains of salt} [#EW] Cities and communication may be vital not only for invention, but also for retaining the vast amounts of knowledge and how-to our civilisation has stored. Also perhaps needed to maintain the technology to retain our knowledge. [#Ster174] Most talents are born away from the major cities, but not too far to be influenced by their talent field. [#Simo239] Larger cities offer more chance for contacts, perhaps also a larger chance to develop genius. [#Imagine191] Suburbia is bad for innovation; increasing the population density increases productivity by up to 28%. [#Sommers70] City life reduces attention span and memory, walking through a park or nature reserve restores cognitive functioning. [#Weiner168[ It's not just about city density, but also about trust and intimacy.

Clarissa: [#Coyl3] Clarissa had a goal in her mind before practice, and compared what she did with what she thought it should sound like?

Clarity: [#Ewquotes] Nobel prize winners express themselves in compact, clear sentences {and seldom avoid discussions} [#Hatt34] Teachers need be clear in communicating success criteria as well as achievements. D=0.75!

Class: [#Time] Upper middle class seems to produce most ambitious people, because(?) it also produces most anxious people. Possibly due to status anxiety.

Class size: [#McK] Is not as important as teacher quality, so if you do not have much money, better pay teachers enough to be competitive with other starting salaries and increase class sizes. [#Hatt88] d is about 0.15, rather small for the huge necessary investment. Note that part of the problem may be that teachers don't adjust their strategies to class size; huge classes (80+) require very directive teaching, rote learning; smaller classes allow grouping and some adaptation of material to the students, and more opportunities for individual feedback – which are seldom used!

Classical conditioning: [#Grin110] Classical conditioning is Pavlovian conditioning, a certain stimulus is followed by a reward, making dogs respond (appropriately?) to a certain stimulus. Fourth of nine learning methods.

Classification: [#NS200816PlayYourCardsRight] Since humans can't hold millions of data points in their head, we must classify/abstract/simplify, which can be a weakness if reality is fine-grained (like poker).

Classroom experience: [#McK] The quality of the classroom experience is highly dependent of the quality of people in the classroom {EW: did that happen at the teacher course I followed?} {may be leading by example; seeing others do things and not being punished for it encourages others to do the same} [#Csik180] Even talented teens generally feel unmotivated in the classroom, and when they feel motivated, it is usually because they are doing something else (like daydreaming or talking to friends). [#Hatt103] Classroom cohesion (clear goals, collaboration, social support) has quite a positive effect on learning, d=0.53.

Classroom management: [#Hatt102] It's quite important (d=0.52) that a teacher is a good classroom manager, intercepting disruptive behaviour. Clarity of purpose and strong guidance combined with concern for the needs and opinions of others also helped.

Clausius, Rudolf: [#Crop96] Stuck with thermodynamics until he found an interesting result. {and searched for laws why processes happen one way and not another? Good observation of engines}. Was good at being clear for himself what he meant, but was bad at making it clear to others {no critical sounding board?}. Youngest of family of 18 children (so not the typical scientist's firstborn). Father principal of small private school. Did some of his most important work in the Polytechnicum in Zurich (predecessor ETH?). Was contentious, not very friendly, rather grouchy and didn't answer Planck's letters.

Claxton, Guy: [#NS271001] Educational psychologist – look him up!

CLE: [#Hatt9] Common Language Effect: If CLE (d) = 0.92, there is a 92% chance that someone from the treated situation exceeds someone from the untreated situation.

Clevers, Hans: [#NRC020612] Second son of four, read a lot, had many pets, wanted to become biologist, university environment was disappointing, no inspiring teachers. Spiced things up with second study (medicine), and exploring the world during internships. Usually tended to have temporary passions. 1-year promotion, was always thinking about next experiment. Does believe in talent, that you can't learn to become a great scientist. Likes sport (marathon running), and also considers social skills important for scientists. Did do postdoc in Harvard. [http://www.intermediair.nl/weekblad/20140515/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2014wk20&utm_campaign=iw&e=1#3] Because he wanted to become really good at something. Knew that DNA had the future, but not much activity in the Netherlands, regulations were unclear, people didn't like to take risks. Good metacog: 'most problems are not worth a meeting. It's better to call a few people, propose a solution, and act. That saves months!] Had good hospital director, who dared to take risks, instead of the traditional director who does everything to prevent damaging his or her image. Laat zich leiden door waar de doorbraken plaatsvinden (team heeft veel patenten enzo). Claimt geen vooropgezet idee te hebben van wat ze willen ontdekken – laboratorium doet vooral waarnemingen. Thinks that non-hierarchic culture in Netherlands helps science – not afraid to displease superiors (+international orientation?)

Cliche: [#McKee67] Cliches come into existence only because the writer does not know the world of his story.

Clinical predictions (vs statistical predictions): [#Hatt253] Clinical predictions (using expert intuition and experience) are almost always inferior to statistical predictions.

Clippy: [#NS271110] Clippy was mainly a distraction, costing users time to finish; and if it was helpful made people credit the computer for their success, so feel worse.

Clothing: [#Nass177] People wearing sloppy or overly informal clothes seem less intelligent than people who are consistent with or overly formal.

Cloze: [#http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm] A technique for learning things using a sentence and letting the student fill in the word that belongs on the …. {EW: would this produce/memorize so much content that the memory would be harder to retrieve in natural situations?}

Clustering: [#Stol96] Grouping items into categories (fish, countries), or arranging them in an order in a story helps memory storage and retrieval <EW: why? I have no idea> [McC683]? Good programmers tend to cluster. [#EricD364] Experts take longer than novices to cluster a problem (45s vs 30s), but also use deep features instead of surface features.

Coaches: [#Coyl192] Futsal coaches and Suzuki coaches both perform extremely well, even if the former barely give any directions. Perhaps they do not need it, as the futsal gives good immediate feedback itself. [#Bloo207] Some good coaches emphasize watching films and reading books on technique. [#EricB532] In chess, at least, the usefulness of having a coach is as of yet unclear. [#CoyleT32] For finding coaches: avoid someone who looks like a courteous waiter, one focusing his or her efforts on making you comfortable and happy. Try find one who invokes feelings of admiration, respect, and even fear in you. Someone who watches you closely, is action-oriented, is honest, often unnervingly so. Someone who gives short, clear directions. Someone who loves teaching fundamentals. Other things being equal, pick the older person.

Coaching: [#EricB446] Coaching and direction of a team influence its views on failure. [#Hatt180] Test coaching works, especially when it's longer term, there is some kind of test coaching, and there's an attempt to train broader cognitive skills. Pre-tests in combination with coaching program are good, as is a more complex/unusual test questions are used. [#RoadToExcel52] Coaching may be less relevant in domains such as chess where less planning is needed for a lesson plan {EW} and where good feedback is available via libraries of existing plays. [#RonaldWolbrink] Many coaches claim that there is a 'self' that has all answers. But most of your 'self' and 'talents' are products of circumstances. Coaches should not suggest that the inner search leads to something, should focus more on changing the context. [#CoyleT86] Use the first moments to connect with people. Second, avoid long speeches, but give short, vivid chunks of information. Third, be concrete – how high should the bat swing? How fast should the music go? (metronome). Make a scorecard (of the correct behaviour). Focus on 'reachfulness' (making people reach). Finally, aim to create independent learners, try create moments of independence..

Coelho, Paulo: [#Robi140] Wanted to be a writer, but his parents let him be treated in an insane asylum with electroshocks to drive that 'madness' out of him. {EW: must have had extreme 'ego-strength'.

Coenen, Trudy: “Voor jaloezie moet je werken. Medelijden krijg je gratis.”

Coevolution: [#Ster368] Coevolution may increase the speed of evolution relative to species in a fixed environment {EW: relation to collaboration? Unexpected and changing directions to take one out of local optima?}

Cognitive ability: [#Eric1993p364] Cognitive ability correlates with 0.5 (so 25%) with early job performance, but barely with later job performance.

Cognitive apprenticeship: [#Clar299] Similar to real apprenticeship, can be very effective in teaching people. Note however that it can even be more effective due to instructors deciding on type and sequence of problems.

Cognitive dissonance: [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/everybody-is-stupid-except-you/201110/living-the-game-fans-in-love-players-work] Paying much for something makes you like it more/increases intrinsic motivation. When changing, works in your favour, as people dislike to act in one way and think in another, will build up to true change and inertia supporting the change. [#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance] The more strongly the anterior cingular cortex and the anterior insular cortex are activated, the greater the reduction in cognitive dissonance. [#Adams18] Cognitive dissonance may suppress information that does not fit into one's stereotypes [EW: really?] [#Hooked139] Also known as 'sour grapes', and explaining/defending to oneself ('others also enjoy beer') We may change our perceptions of something in order to reduce cognitive dissonance.

Cognitive fusion: [#HayesS57] Treating our thoughts as if they are what they say they are.

Cognitive interest: [#Clar366] Stimulate cognitive interest by understandable, coherent lessons (avoid non-essential technical terms, logical sequences, transitions, headers, summaries, charts and tables), concrete and vivid language and examples (especially in the main points of a lesson), using a conversational rather than a didactic tone in your materials (also a visible author or agent, like Herman the bug rather than disembodied explanations), add familiarity; analogies or pointing towards previous lessons.

Cognitive load: [#Clar86] Complexity of content, experience, presentation rate and control, and instructional modes and methods (picture+text higher load than picture+audio). Note that cognitive load can be too low; in that case the learner does not expend effort and is not learning anything. [#Zill204] The closer a game fills the cognitive capacity of a gamer, the more the gamer forgets that it's a game, and the more immersed he or she is [EW: like flow?]. Different levels are used to accommodate players of different skill, and 'safe zones' can help pause if some rest is needed.

Cognitive reactivity: [#http://www.awkruijt.nl/thesis/ p68 ev] The amount of negative thought which are activated (brought to consciousness) by somewhat sad experiences)

Cognitive reappraisal: [#Nass155] Describing a video with an air of scientific detachment dramatically decreases the arousal by an experience (measured in heart rate, for example). Even (lying) that the procedure was neither painful nor dangerous, and that the boys looked forward to it, were dramatically effective at calming participants. Also, saying that things are dependent on the situation (the design of that car makes it hard for them to see you) also decreases arousal. Can work wonders from unlinking the situation from your goals/lessening the threat to your goals. Everyday use of cognitive reappraisal results in feeling more positive and fewer negative emotions, more life satisfaction and more optimism. Also better interactions with others.

Cognitive rehearsal: [#Burn193] Mentally preparing for a situation, imagining the least problematic situation first as vividly as possible, and writing your thoughts down and evaluate them.

Cognitive remediation therapy: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_remediation_therapy] Works against schizophrenia and eating disorders. Looks a bit like cognitive behavioural therapy, but focuses on malfunctioning neurons instead of malfunctioning emotions, teaching strategies and drill-and-practice, often with the computer.

Cognitive strategies: [#Stol95] Strategies that enhance storage in and retrieval from memory. The six main ones are clustering, spatial, advance organizers, image-rich comparisons, repetition, memory aids.

Cognitive task: [#Hatt185] Cognitive tasks often need fewer trials and shorter practice sessions compared to motor and strength tasks.

Cognitive task analysis: [#Clar296] Cognitive task analysis (interviewing practitioners, trainers, novices) can help find out what skills are required to perform a real-world-task well. Note that one usually also needs to watch the expert perform, as experts often do not know how they do tasks! Cognitive task analysis can be expensive though, so using it to base learning programmes on is mostly only worthwhile in critical tasks which stay relatively stable over time.

Cognitive therapy: [#Burnsxviii] Is it really true that thoughts produce feelings? More likely it is some kind of feedback loop, if hoped-for results do not materialize, the brain gets into a negative emotional state and therefore more strongly recalls negative thoughts and memories; and since if you are in a bad mood you tend to mull, the negative thoughts are rehearsed, strengthening the effect. In normal circumstances, there either would come a reward, or, like children, proto-humans were not that good at mulling. Perhaps also because proto-humans did not have the brainpower to have powerful expectations and therefore be disappointed. En ook: dat is waarom neuroten eerder depressief zijn! Eerder sterke negatieve gevoelens!

Coherence: [#EricB574] Similar to 'simple', coherent narratives (one focal point) are much more convincing.

Coherent representation: [#Kluw237] A coherent representation inhibits competing representations by lateral inhibition, so you can't see a picture in two ways at the same time.

Coincidence: [#Strien306] In geniuses, coincidence usually occurs in the younger years, like Gauss' school master discovering his genius and recommending him to the local duke.

Collaboration: [#Johnxv] While teams that work together for a short period tend to show group-think, teams that work over longer time, when collaborators have chosen to work together and when they complement each other, and when they allow themselves to be mutually vulnerable (so there needs be trust!), they are more productive and report greater satisfaction than individuals working alone. If competition is minimized and people strive for a shared vision. One needs right mixture of difference and similarity, in skills and backgrounds of participants, and in the way conflict is negotiated and resolved. Collaboration produces encouragement that can wash away individual doubts and despair. Can evolve from one collaborator doing simple work to slowly getting more say and more complex tasks as his or her experience increases {EW: similar to guilds?}. Backgrounds can complement each other: Will Durant's wife was much more critical of the Popes and prompted her husband to pay more attention to the Jews. Mixture of fierce belief in the work of the other AND willingness to criticize (though criticism has to be manoevered correctly, sometimes the other is asked not to worry about the commas, especially in the beginning of a collaboration criticism can be too jarring). Collaboration encourages you to take more chances by spreading the risk a bit. Observations that make a situation immediately clear are important. Gender: men often pay more attention to details and research, women to imagination. Collaboration can not only be between sexual partners, but also between siblings (Brontës). Would sibling collaboration be strengthened by parental unavailability? {EW: if parents ARE available, perhaps more competition. Me and Nan for home-mom?} - but sometimes present parents can let one child mentor and teach the other, at least that worked for the Dreyfuses {may depend on the child's personality and philosophy of life 'Henkie de Huistiran'}. Shared opposition to something can count as a shared value too. Sometimes the collaborator can work as an external critic, so the internal critic cannot choke the process. Friends can extend your imagination (like the poet Appolinaire did with Picasso). But Picasso also used 'collaboration' in the form of studying the works of great past artists. Collaboration can also be financial (like Theo for Vincent van Gogh, even though Vincent also relied on his brother for emotional support/validation). Envy and resentment can also crop up. Intense relationships seem to terminate after about a decade, but can last longer if the partners are sensible enough to keep part of their own life and resolve conflicts. Some people prepare for the actual working together by reading the same books at the same time, and writing each other their thoughts and ideas regularly, before sitting down to do the actual work together {Ajolt and me?}. Can go through different phases, idea phase is great and fun, deadline phase is more solitary. Trying to adopt the spirit of the collaborator whose work you are rewriting? People may need a break from each other/time alone though, else the collaboration may become too oppressing. Differences in recognition for shared work may also lead to stresses. And you cannot only do the real work, there is 'overhead' in ensuring that the other feels cared for and heard. Collaboration can also be between parent and child, from mentoring slowly to more equal relationships. Can giving too much recognition to junior collaborators ever be bad? Collaborators often need to do some work alone, other work is done together, like an ebb and flow. Collaborators do not necessarily communicate verbally with each other: drawings, designs, music and whatever else is possible also can be used. Giving up some freedom to expand your range by a great amount? John-Steiner distinguishes four types: distributed collaboration (informal exchange of thoughts, no shared goal), complementarity collaboration (shared goal, complementary expertise and/or character), family collaboration (roles shift over time or are flexible). Integrative collaboration would be a partnership in which something new is invented {EW: new versus very new?}[#Robi74] 'The Traveling Wilburys' uit Harrisson en andere uitstekende popsterren, is ook een voorbeeld van uitmuntende samenwerking.[#EricB440] Teams need to have a shared mental model of the task, the situation, the team members and the equipment. Prebrief – perform – debrief, have clear roles and responsibilities. [#C2W] Seeking collaboration with prominent scientists can increase funding, which increases publications, which aids collaboration... [#Wiki] Wooden's assistant coach proposed adapting the strategy to the team's strength, which worked. Even the best coach does not know everything, but the wisest one can profit from good advice and excellent people. [#Gawan67] Multiple pairs of eyes are better to spot mistakes. Man is fallible, but men are less so [though for some tasks computers can help find some clashes/problems automatically]. People need room to act and adapt, but they cannot work as isolated agents, that would be anarchy, they need a contradictory mix of freedom and expectation. [#Med23] Competition in cooperation can be very dangerous in the long run, beware that. [#Med34] Usually, ideas in a small group of scientists spark off each other, it's hard to tell who originated the idea, but its very powerful. But only collaborate if you like and admire your collaborators. [#SellHuman196] Make your partner look good; it will make you look good as well. [#C2W260413] If people come with questions in a late stage, it's much harder to help them than if they come early. [#Imagine153] High performers consulted anywhere from 4 to nine organisational colleagues (on a given project), low performers contacted one or two colleagues at most. [#156] Office where colleagues relocate have plummeting productivity due to fistfights over territory and difficulty in finding each other. [#LUMagazine, Ellemers: In collaboration, it are usually not the differences between people, that give trouble, it's the expectation from both parties that they will approach the problem in the same way (especially if they are similar in many ways). [#Hargit101] One Nobel-prize winner described his relation with another as 'a relationship of complete trust'. [#Hargit133] Crick and Brenner shared an office, they were generating ideas all the time and found it important to bounce those off each other [#Hargit140] Marshall Nirenberg went to the lab of Alfinsen to discuss something, but found a young exchange scientist who happened to know the only known solvent for polyphenylalanine. [#Hargit147] The success of CERN may lie in that French, Germans and British have very different mentalities, and together can work miracles. Sometimes you simply want support, a secertary or department head who does unpleasant jobs, or (like Linus Pauling had) Robert Corey, one of America's best-trained crystallographers. Spouses (read: wives) are often great supporters, either as scientists or as homemakers. [#150] Victor Hamburger stimulated his associates to perform more than they would have thought themselves capable of “You and I are good, but together we are wonderful” [#Hargit177] Townes worked together with astronomers, since they knew where the sky was but could not learn complicated spectroscopy techniques overnight (so he had to know about radioastronomy...) [#Hargit233] Meitner was a physicist, Hahn a chemist. [#hargit241] Berson a doctor, Yalow a physicist; taught each other things about each other's field, and together developed radioimmuneassays. [#242] There is an example of researchers, while not physically close, collaborating in great harmony.(Huffman /Kratschmer ; interestingly, both are withdrawn people) [#NRC131110] Collaboration is influenced by group size, willingness to collaborate, the strength of leaders, how much energy is spent on detecting cheaters, and the size of the resource (the forest). [#Jansen82] When moving to biology and wanting to have his own lab, but not knowing to run it, the director told him to hire lab people to run his lab! [#EinsteinsLight/EW] Lorenz was ouder/ervarener dan Einstein, adviseerde hem ook om voorspellingen te maken die experimenteel geverifieerd konden worden. [#https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/nieuws/2016/10/hebzucht-en-angst-remmen-samenwerking?utm_source=161004-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=hebzucht-en-angst-remmen-samenwerking&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Greed and fear (especially fear that one’s efforts mainly benefit others) limit collaboration.

Collaborative learning: [#Clar223] Collaborative learning works better than competitive or individual learning. But only if they have a structured task, group size is small (2-5), groups are heterogenous, the format requires everyone's input, and the score/grade is not based solely on group outcome but also on individual contributions {EW: how!?}

Colleagues: [#http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/apr/09/advertising] Paul Arden encouraged people to work with the best in the business, no matter how difficult or demanding.

Collective identification: [#NRC101211] Despite the individualisation of society, our identification with our collective group (gender, family, age, work) is even bigger. However, religion and tradition have gotten smaller roles, our new influences are multimedia and schools.

Coltrane, John: [#Greene31] After having played the saxophone for a few years, became entranced by a performance by Charlie Parker. But even before that was more serious, and felt more emotional and spiritual than his schoolmates. Knew that Parker was an intense student of all types of music and practiced harder than anyone. Coltrane himself bounced along from band to band for five years, each band with a different style and repertoire of songs. Would every few months experiment with a new sound he had heard. Coltrane was also a loner who loved to study, what helped.

Comfort: [#Greene203] If you have had success, continue striving for creativity instead of the popularity of the status-quo (which makes you conservative).

Commentary: [#Zill165] Commentary can fool people in thinking that an action they saw themselves was more violent than it actually was.

Commercials: [#Int250311]

Commitment: [#Coyl103] The most determining factor in music lessons progress is how long a child plans to play (a month – a year – one's entire life?). Long-term commitment and high average weekly practice makes for the most progress. {perhaps this reflects the importance the child or its parents assign to practice, which is investing in attention}[#Fors33] There is a difference between being interested in something and committed to something. If you want success, be committed, even though it may mean making choices. Ask yourself: how will it feel when I have done this? Once you have made a commitment, all the relevant work pertaining to it needs be done. There is no “important” or “unimportant” anymore. Rather cut commitment than tasks, and commitments need regular pruning! [#Gold66] Making an active commitment (writing down when you volunteer instead of not writing in a not-do-form) enlarges commitment, it's similar to goal-setting. [#Influence57] Commitment and consistency are very powerful persuasive devices: as we have a personal and interpersonal desire to be consistent with what we did [note that that works best if we do not blame exterior pressures; subtle rewards work better]. People feel more sure they made the right choice after a final/expensive decision [so betters are more certain their horse will win]. Can deciding also serve as a medicine against doubt? Toy stores undersupply cool items, so parents who can't buy them at christmas buy them later, and buy something extra for Christmas to make up the 'broken promise'. Once you are committed (or someone makes you commit), the road back is hard. Asking someone to predict whether they would do something will increase the chance that they'll do it (by 700%! - Cancer Society collecting). Asking if you are well makes you feel stingy if you subsequently refuse a charitable/'charitable' request, doubles success rate. Chinese torturers/'agents' started with small commitments, later making them larger and more public, based on the consistency principle. Small commitments can lead to other self-image, so identity-based choices. Especially what we do determines how we (and others!) see us, more than our words (even though words also help); other people especially are bad at taking mitigating circumstances into account. Also hearing that other people see you as charitable makes you more likely to be charitable. Letting customer fill in the sales agreement also works better for commitment than making the salesman do it [even with pushy salesmen]. Public statements increase the need to look like a consistent person + decrease openness to new, contradicting information. The more work you perform for a commitment (writing > speaking, initiation ordeal > writing), the more effective the commitment {EW: is committing like learning?}. Active, public, effortful commitment works best. Each individual has the right level of threat/reward to produce the behaviour yet make it internal. Lowballing: first give attractive offer (on new car or on old car), let person sign commitment forms, but then discover the 'mistake'. Similarly you can pull the rug out under new behaviour: energy saving by saying that their names would be published. Protection: listen to your stomach, and explain what the other person is doing (that usually scares them off). Second way: if I could go back in time, knowing what I know now, would I still make the same decision? (kissing magazine salesmen: help win contest + small favour – larger favour (franklin)) [#McGon90] Asking people how committed they are to a goal (instead of how much progress they feel have made towards the goal) are not tempted by the conflicting behavior.

Committees: [#Meda53] Committees, especially of old and 'expert' scientists, can be overly conservative and cocksure, and lack in imagination and shrewdness, being too confident in their own view even given all uncertainty or lack of data about a new field. [#Sommers112] If committee meetings are pleasant or peaceful affairs, you're not getting enough out of them – seek different perspectives, like Lincoln's 'team of rivals'

Common sense: [#Redirect24] Policy makers often rely on common sense to decide what works or what to do. EW: common sense works- except in cases where it doesn't.

Communication: [#NS050414TheDeathOfIndividuality] Patterns of communication (who talked to whom and how much they talked) is far more important than the characteristics of the individuals, and are usually the single most important factor in both creativity and productive output. [#NS220616Don'tGiveUpTheDayJob] The more cohesive and communicative a team is – the more they chat and gossip – the more they get done. [#Schmid198] Know the difference between messaging and conversation (with the press). Ideally, you want conversation. [#Evans29] You can communicate with more than speech (clothes, body language, etc.) [#Schmid184] Communication needs to be repeated, but don’t flood people; just a few core themes. And is the communication novel, interesting, fun, inspirational, or sparks conversation? To the right people, using the right medium?

Communication and cooperation skills: [#EricB380] Communication and cooperation skills seem to be an important part of being an expert programmer.

Communities of practice: [#EricB260] Similar to tribes, communities of practice offer models, resources and standards. Also inspiration and long-term support! [#EricB623] Can also make tacit, practical knowledge explicit. [#EricB624] Have financial value to companies!

Companies: [#EW] Especially big, hierarchical companies tend to suffer from human psychology gone wrong: information from the bottom (or from outside) does not percolate to the top, also because promotions are awarded to those who don't bring bad news, promotions are given to those who 'hobnob' with others instead of ensuring the smooth functioning of their division [#TransitieNL] If there is a long supply chain of companies, the wishes of the final customer are often all but ignored. Lots of management is often also superfluous (thuiszorg/buurtzorg). And what will happen if we go from possession to usage [so borrow a car or carpool?] [#EW/JeroenK] People at companies may have a better idea of things that are of 'general interest' to people than the average university professor (Jeroen – toxicophores). [#NRC120613NederlandseValleyAlsInnovatieCampus] Seed companies in the NL mainly competed, until they realized they could lobby together.  [#EW] Companies may be dangerous for innovation, entrerpreneurship like in Florence can be better. Otherwise danger that bosses are too micromanaging (how to do things) or employees don’t dare to be better than their boss, which is problematic as bosses generally are quite ignorant about the ‘executive details’ Competition for status (like at court) can also be deadly. Perhaps that is also why servant-leadership is important. [#Catmul138] A company must achieve some kind of balance – the interests of no single group (whether finances, marketing, or artists) should override all the others. But it is a dynamic balance, like surfing, and needs to be constantly monitored. [#Schmid5] Focus on the user – money will come. Aim for happy users in preference of happy customers. [#223] 70/20/10 rule, core business gets 70% of the resources, 20% on emerging (some early successes), 10% on new (big risk, big opportunity) [EW: why not for hiring?]. [#235] Ship and iterate, while measuring which things gain momentum with iteration/improvements, and starve the losers. So not necessarily much marketing at the beginning, ‘soft opening’. Horseback law: make quick assessment of situation, don’t cover every angle. Spend 80% of time on 80% of revenue. And think about succession! But judge them as you judged your own (or successful people’s capacities) at that age, not at your own age. Find a coach. Share virtually anything (except for what is forbidden by laws or regulations). OKRs are public. Ask people “what is going on in your job? What issues do you have? Tell me about that deliverable you owe me.” Listen to the engineers, not just to the managers (snippets: weekly status reports, what people are working on, what they have achieved). Shared with everyone, like OKRs. Give good people opportunities to explore other things (like management positions) even if you have to create that position! Let managers trade their best in rotations. People want to be heard, to be relevant and valued. Are there members of your team who, if they told you they were leaving, you would not fight hard to keep?  Try to avoid business units (though functional organisations like engineering, finance and such are fine according to Google), as it stifles the free flow of information and business units may put their own benefit above the benefit of the company. Try to do reorganisations in one day (or at most a few weeks), even if you don’t have a perfect plan – people will help adjust it on the fly. “Rule of seven”: each manager should have at least 7 direct reports, to prevent them from micromanaging. Company values necessary for employees to make tough decisions. Say “yes”, try to minimize the ‘no’s’ by only installing procedures, meetings and approval gates when absolutely necessary. Invest in the team, not in the plan. The plan is always flawed, so the people have to be right. Also bet on technical insights, not market research, as market research does not highlight the problems the customer can’t conceive as solvable. Find your technology by finding the geeks working on new, interesting stuff? Whatever the stuff is, that is your technology. Other way is to look at technology and try apply it more broadly (steam pump was created to pump water out of mines) Optimize for growth (long term) [so make better search engine, don’t focus too much on putting ads up). Opt for open, unless you can have a really extreme impact (much better than your competitors)

Company culture: [#Schmid30] Company culture is hard to change. Dimensions: what do we care about? What do we believe? Who do we want to be? How do we want or company to act and make decisions? Vision needs to be reinforced with rewards, and communicated consistently.

Comparing: [#Int181111] People seldom look at their absolute level of skill, but compare themselves to others. If that is in their disadvantage, they either try to take that as an opportunity to learn and grow, or take more distance from the other [friendship and family relationships cool if people are in the same field but the one is much more successful than the other – scientists have worse relation with their fathers if areas of research look more like another], or claim that the domain that you don't excel in is not that important. [#SellHuman134] 'It is springtime and I am blind'. Often understand something better when we see it in comparison with something else; the 'contrast principle'. 'Compared to what' is a good question to ask. [#Sommers139] When people compare themselves to others, they usually compare themselves to people who are less-well off.

Comparison and contrast-effects: [#Pers22] When exposed to images of more attractive mates, people become dissatisfied with their own mate. <EW: presumably that also goes for cars etc.>

Compassion: [#Int] American organisation sponsoring and encouraging disadvantaged youths “that you can become more than you ever thought possible”. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201105/how-make-more-rational-and-compassionate-financial-decisions] Compassion counteracts feelings of anger, so reduces them in the unfairly divided 20$ task; alternative route for that was more willpower/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Meditators had more theory of mind/empathy/compassion. Apparently, you can't be compassionate and angry at the same time [walking in other people's shoes] http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201103/the-power-self-compassion Self-compassion also helps; writing letter to yourself, have understanding for your distress, as if you'd write it to a friend in your position, soothing, comforting, encouraging. Increases happiness and reduces anxiety for up to six months afterwards. Also makes it more likely to get back to goal after setback or failure, makes you take more personal responsibility towards failure, and makes you more responsive to feedback. + joy of learning for its own sake. [#NS191013] If you look at shared values with another group (like 'they want their children educated just like mine') it will change how you perceive your responsibility towards others.

Competence: [#Pers210] People like to be competent, and men especially are unlikely to show behaviour if you make clear they seem incompetent in that.

Competing activities: [#EricB466] Competing activities may shy children away from choosing music as a career (rigorous training) {EW: more choices make less happy people? Dilution of skills until lower value of separate skills, and lower/too low population of teachers? Or general Xerxes effect, in which skill gives little added value?}

Competition: [#Coyl134] Skip Engblom sometimes 'casually' remarked to the Z-boys that so-and-so had done a particular trick last week. [#Gall122] Competition can also be a form of cooperation as you work to put obstacles in the path of the other to make him or her stronger. [#EricB687] Competitions are necessary in some fields to gain access to the best teachers and training environments. [#Csik108] While math competitions make math less lonely and therefore more attractive to some students, they tend to alienate other students who don't feel comfortable in such a competitive environment, especially girls. [#Volkskrant] Boys like competition (and status) more, especially when they feel the representative of their group.[#Pers338] Competition can decrease intrinsic motivation. [#Interm141011] Foreigners in soccer teams increase the quality of soccer, even in the national team (where there are no foreigners) – competition inspires more competence in the rest? [#Franzen243] Competition only leads to better outcomes when tasks are simple, and speed is more important than quality. [#Stalla28] Wooden emphasized that one should compete against an ideal, not against people. [#Schmid29] “How exciting is it to come to work if the best you can do is trounce some other company who does roughly the same thing?” (Larry Page). Don’t focus on your competition, but keep an eye on them. Keeps you sharp, helps avoid complacency.

Complacency: [#EW] As soon as ones performance is 'good enough', most people stop improving and slowly automate the behaviour, 'fixing' it on their current level of competence. Top performers however systematically try to isolate areas of weakness that are holding them back, consciously improving them. [#Tonn112] Even when you're a star, you can never be complacent, as many young upstarts are dying and vying to take your place. [#NS080314GreenGreenbacks] Companies (and people?) are often much less efficient than they could be, but lack the impetus to improve; but a challenge (do something using fewer resources) together with the resources to discover a better way can have amazing results; carpet tile manufacturer Interface cut its energy use by 40% since 1996, and is notw the largest tile company in the world. Challenge or “invest in process” rule of thumb.

Complexity: [#Eyse108] A preference for complexity correlates to creativity. {perhaps because low complexity does not stimulate the brain as much?} [#Csik157] The ideal family {or teacher?} is complex: gives lots of support, but challenges/places demands as well. Integration produces positive moods, differentiation challenge. I-D: much time spent on leisure, D-I: much time spent on chores. Teens in complex families spend more time in productive work and are more alert doing it (consider it more important). Also, teens from complex families have better grades (despite slightly lower apparent intellect), second place is for the differentiated teens [at least in teacher ratings, not in grades!]. Though for athletics the score is below the differentiated groups! The Goertzels [#Csik174] claim that the families of the true geniuses are less integrated, though very differentiated. [#Syed238] When a sport is relatively little complex (like sprinting), genetic differences may matter relatively more than in sports where learned aspects like coordination and such are paramount. [#Gawande49] Some philosophers divide problems in three categories: the simple, the complicated, and the complex. Simple problems: step-by-step solution known (IKEA). Complicated problems: basic principles are known, but you need to combine them appropriately (combinatorial search, often multiple experts needed). Complex problems are like raising a child: even the laws are not known, actions have unpredictable consequences {EW: if laws are not known, or a process has also inputs which are beyond your knowledge or control}: so: simple recipe, limited by combinatorial explosion, limited by ignorance. In scientific evolution, ignorance slowly makes way to combinatorial explosion, may eventually become checklist though when finding has been made, or computer program is in list. [#Franzen218] Complex goals can be achieved in several different ways, leading to long deliberations, increasing uncertainty and decreasing satisfaction with the result. [#EW030713] If you are writing about a complex subject, and no elegant order comes to mind: do the 10 in tactic. If you feel still no 'nice' structure is forthcoming, either increase intervals by one week, then two weeks, or simply start writing and then wait a week. [#NS300515] Reducing the complexity of sending the message that you don't like  a certain post or picture on Facebook by offering a pre-generated message instead of a blank textbox raises response rates from 20% to 50%, adding a multiple choice so people can give a reason raises it to 60%. [#EW] Scientists can create very complicated things, like molecular motors, but if you need too much skill to do something with them, chances that they diffuse throughout society are small; they will sooner be forgotten.

Compliance: [#Influencexiv] Compliance = self-interest + rest (techniques used on/by you). Part of techniques is using 'fixed action patterns', like turkeys. But people have it with signals like 'because' “Can I use the copy machine because I have to make copies” is as effective as “Can I use the copy machine because I'm in a rush”. Heuristics like “expensive is good” (especially if you have no subject knowledge). We use stereotypes or else there is too much information to process ('brain strain')

Compliment: [#Gall29] Compliments may also activate the judgmental mind, and make people do their best and fail (fear of losing praise).[#Myst150] Also: she may live up to the compliment if she agrees and considers it flattering to her. [#NS280412] Most college students crave compliments more than money, seeing a best friend, or drinking alcohol.

Compulsions: [#Hooked1] Checking one's cellphone is so ubiquitous (over 30 times a day) that it may have ascended from being a mere habit to a compulsion, to be called upon in moments of doubt, boredom, or stress. “internal triggers”, in 'hooked-speak'

Computer games: [#NS290314Screens are not all bad, the iPad is today's novel] No effects on behaviour for kids who play computer games (while 3 h TV/day gives a small increase in behavioral problems over 1 h TV/day)

Computers: [#EricB532] Computer databases and playing computers are replacing books in chess practice, with good results.[#NS171015BottomOfTheClass] Investments in IT seem to fail to pay off in school grades, students perform worse at school if they have computers in their bedroom. Also suggested that taking notes by hand works better than typing them into a laptop

Computers in teaching: [#Hatt223] The effectiveness of computers in teaching increases as teachers have had extra instruction in how to use the computer as a learning tool.Most important characteristics are learner control, not losing sight of the learning goal, and the immediate announcement of correctness or otherwise of the answers of the drill. Drill and practice via computer are often more effective than traditional teaching! Learning in pairs behind the computer is more effective than learning as individuals or learning in larger groups. Explanation and remediation are more effective than just providing the right answer. And challenging tasks (d=0.13) work much better than moderately challenging tasks (d= -0.34) or non-challenging tasks (d= -0.57)

COMT-gene: [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2013/doasisay.html?utm_source=130326-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=doasisay&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Children with the methionine variant of the gene handle authoritarian mothers worse than the children with the V-variant, however in both cases sensitive parents are better able to get the children to do as they say than less sensitive parents. Sensitivity: how adequate they are in responding on signals of the child, and how well they gave support with difficult problems.

Conative traits: [#EricB155] A fancy name for 'motivation'/interest.

Conceit: [#Watt39] Never consider yourself wise or flawless, remain humble.

Concentration: [#Csik97] Concentration levels of talented teens are higher than normal for coursework, but lower for TV and socializing. [#Csik143] Concentration is very high for every talent area, except athletics (waiting for ones turn in a meet?) [#Scho26] Something gets more emotional value if you make it more concrete and attractive, or by letting go of competition <EW?>. Establish its size: beginning, ending, scope. Unity and liveliness help, as does bizarreness/unexpectedness. <EW: SMASHIN’SCOPE?/SUCES> [#Scho126] Having an “empty five minutes' before starting a difficult task (think 'I am totally empty') can help you get rid of distractions and start in top-shape.

Concept map: [#EricB211] Similar to mind maps (concepts linked with arrows called after relationships), mostly used for education. Can be used to show gaps in knowledge. Concept maps of experts are remarkably similar. Software can be downloaded for free at the IHMC. May be the most efficient method for knowledge elicitation. [#Hatt168] Concept mapping is useful for students, especially when they provide the terms, and construct, rather than study the maps. Best after initial exposure to the material to be mapped (so not before or during).

Conceptual combination: [#Ster203] Two concepts only yield emergent (not-present-before) properties if their combination is rather unfamiliar (fruit that is also furniture versus a bird that is also a pet). Usually created by finding a relation to link them, use a property of one in the other, or creating a hybrid.

Conceptual expansion: [#Ster195] Many 'creative' products are just small variations on products a person already knows {EW: the more you know, the more creative you can be?} People asked to draw animals on an alien planet draw animals that are in many respect (bilateral symmetry, 2/4 legs) very similar to earth animals.

Concessions: [#HaidtH57] Concession leads to concession (elephant – tit-for-tat). Note also that in bargaining, taking an extreme position at first is better, as you get a better deal (and the other person also feels more poweful/feels happier about the agreement.

Concreteness: [#Watt130] Always understand the things behind the words, do not mindlessly try to memorize meaningless phrases. [#EricB392] Concrete language is important for comprehension, if a text is abstract, it doesn't help if the material is unfamiliar or familiar.

Conditional negative regard: [#Redirect84] Witholding affective behaviour if the other does something wrong. (“If I get low grades, my mother will ignore me for a while.”). Makes kids feel that parents are overly controlling and does not help them from internalizing the goals; also causes less engagement at school.

Conditional positive regard: [#Redirect84] Parents showing more affection to their children when children do something well. Children become more interested in grades than in the academic material.

Conditioning: [#Kluw162] Simple conditioning seems to be able to work even in amnesics – apparently there are basal routes left. However, if the stimulus becomes more complex, conditioning may need the coordinating activity of the hippocampus and various parts of the brain.[#Burn178] Wives can condition their husbands much better by rewarding good behaviour instead of punishing bad behaviour, and keeping meticulous scientific records of interactions (what you do – and what is the result, such as length of phone call).

Conditions: [#Hargitxiii] Choose the right place to work with generous sponsors to support you [resources?], right animal to work on, choose excellent colleagues who want to help you and work hard, and that they find colleagues and students as well. [work hard!]

Confabulation: [#HaidtH8] The left hemisphere is very good at giving any explanation for behaviour, even if it is not aware of the true causes (like in split-brain patients, where the left hand may try to stop the right hand).

Conferences: [#Medawar14] Graduate research, as well as attending conferences, usually gives graduate students powers of judgment they wish they had before embarking upon their graduate work.

Confidence: [#EricB430] Most people have great confidence in their own decisions, especially under certain circumstances (for example, explaining those decisions to others). Probably people defer to agents and consultants less often than they should.[#EW] The confidence in ones abilities is affected by feedback from the environment: CEOs, professors and dictators tend to get overconfident/huge egos due to mostly being praised and seldom being publicly criticized due to fear for reprisal. In many cases, this leads to mounting egos ending only when their wrong judgement, unabated by criticism by inferiors, brings their career and sometimes even their lives crashing down. {Hitler's invasion of Russia, for example} Children may be born with lots of confidence and 'lack of' fear of failure, making them try things that adults would deem impossible. {would this be because they don't have big ego's yet, because they have not been taught to fear failure, or because their brain areas are more sensitive to reward and less sensitive to punishment than adult's?} [#Ster27] Confidence in ones abilities is one characteristic of Cox's geniuses. [#EricB25] Experts tend to be overconfident in their abilities. [#Stol38] One of the three main factors in motivation. If confidence in one's ability to learn or do something is too large or too small, the motivation will be low. The high point is at challenge and security (“I have to work to succeed, but if I DO work at it, I can succeed”). [#Zill164] One's confidence in one's own abilities and talents is increased/decreased by seeing a sport's team win/lose. [#NS190512] Most people have overconfidence, very few are underconfident.

Configuration: [#Strien133/EW] Would the seeking mind form sub-configurations unconsciously, which can later act as cores for further idea-building, even if they are not perceived consciously? Must be if intuition works. Or even 'forbidden' configurations which are not fertile and avoid search in that direction? [#146] Can in any case occur in sleep.

Confirmation: [#Feist66] Falsification may not always be the best strategy in science at all times; great scientists tend to first want to conform a theory, and after it passes the first confirmations they try to disconfirm it.

Confirmation bias: [ http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~dunbarlab/pubpdfs/FugelsangSteinGreenDunbarCJEP2004.pdf] Usually scientists are reluctant to accept results that are inconsistent with their theories, however, when those results turn out to be reproducible, they will try to adjust the theory instead. Note that over half of the results (223/417) found in the biology laboratories visited by Dunbar were inconsistent with researcher's prior expectations! Most often (197) scientists blamed methodology, in the minority they used or adapted alternative theories. About one third (84) of the inconsistent findings was replicated; if replicated, scientists had 61% chance to modify their theories.

Conflict: [#Catmul139] Conflict is essential (in a creative organisation).

Confluence: [#EricD363] All minor rules that can be deduced from a major rule: if A+B=C, then if A increases and B is constant, C increases. If C increases and A is constant, B must increase. If C increases while A is decreasing, B must increase more than A decreases, etc.

Conformism: [#Greene142] Deviant people make the people in a group feel insecure. Interesting gauge is how much people feel the need to display certain opinions or ideas that conform to the standards. [#285] Humans are deep conformists – qualities that separate us from others are often ridiculed. [#Sommers102] Cults often use uniform dress and abandonment of given names to reduce feelings of individuality, as do communal living arrangements far away from the rest of society (found labels indicating function of every shelf in Heaven's Gate house; so eliminated ambiguity, doubt or stress or arguments?}. [#105] Having a forceful leader is great for conformity. You can use conformity by modeling the actions you'd like to see in others (like the crowd whisperer does).

Conformity: [#Root] The best scientists worked when they felt like it – might have been hard to get along with conventional bosses then! [#Ster299] The more easily a person buckles under conformity pressure, the less creative he or she is (well, correlation, probably not perfect).

Congresses: [#Sieg/EW] Most scientists go to congresses to talk, not to listen. What a waste. I think Cavendish did that better.

Connecting: [#Stol90] The third major metacognitive skill, the good learner continuously seeks to build linkages with prior knowledge, seeks meaningful analogies and mnemonics. [#Catmul233] When connecting/communicating with people, it is important to ‘meet them where they are’, to learn their point of view, and adjust to how they like to communicate. With mindfulness: see what is there, let hope and fear go away.

Connection: [#Ster94] There always needs to be a connection/community between creator and the norms of society (even if translators and educators can bridge the gap from the different directions), else the product will not be considered creative.

Connections: [#EW] Would mice find it impossible to learn some relationships (like between a light flashing and toxic water) because the brain regions are not connected enough, so dual activation of neurons does not create/strengthen a bond between them? Connecting ideas, thinking about ideas, probably both strengthens memory and encourages creativity.[#Root] Understanding the connections between different subjects is also handy. [#John42] Einstein claimed, next to his ability to visualize and use kinesthesia, the ability to apply what others have discovered on his own problems.

Conner (Bart): [#Robi45] A boy who learned himself to walk on his hands, but was praised by his family and friends for it. Discovered 'paradise' when gym teacher took him to gymnastics {turnen?} centre, and became an Olympic gold medalist.

Conscientiousness: [#Nett142] C is the best predictor of occupational success across the board; low C may give otherwise ambitious individuals a kind of laziness. Is ability to follow internally set goals and plans. Slightly negative relation to intelligence. May be stressful after leaving formal education, as the next goal is suddenly unclear. [#NS240115”Do you have a healthy personality?”] Very conscientious people have the lowest levels of inflammation, extroverts the highest.

Conscious competence model: [#EW/#Wiki] Posited by Maslow. {perhaps the unconscious stages contain pattern recognition, the conscious stages analytical thought which is slower but can help rub in new patterns}

Consciousness: [#Gallxvii] Consciousness, especially emotions like fear and worry, tends to hamper the unconscious motoric skills. The conscious mind should therefore either be silenced or occupied with something related but innocuous. {EW: and science/chemistry? What's the role of the unconscious there?} [#NS261111] Things come into consciousness when neurons start firing in synchrony. [#NS080314ConscioueAndTheBrainStanislasDeHaene] May have evolved to pick out what is relevant from hige amount of parallel activity, and keep it active within the global workspace while different part of the brain evaluate it [EW: parallel to programming?] Moment of consciousness usually means that regions of the parietal and prefrontal cortex are activated, which are never reached by the gentle waves of subconscious activity. Then activation goes to a much larger expanse of the cortex, and distant brain regions start showing tightly correlated activity. Consciousness as brain-wide information sharing? [#NS010717ThePointOfConsciousness] Consciousness can enhance learning, as subconscious information always influences our action, but if the information becomes conscious (that is, enough time to process), we can ignore it. Helpful if previous/automatic behaviour is wrong (so can change model more rapidly), process in which unconscious learns is likely much slower. [#NS160917FirstContactWithATrappedBrain]  Many processes, like face recognition and audio processing, are also done by sedated/unconscious persons.

Consequences: [#EricB513] Attending to the consequences of ones actions (swinging the club) seems to be better for learning than attending to the actions oneself (swinging the arm). Perhaps focusing on the actions limits ones ability to flexibly implement motor plans.

Consistency: [#Syed94] Being able to perform consistently gives great conditions for feedback. {EW: somewhere else in the literature: experts are much better at reproducing their performance than novices} [#Sommers100] You can also get many more students agree to be there at a 7:00 psychological experiment if they commit themselves to participating first. [#Hooked138] People want to be consistent; if you get them to agree to a small favor, they are more likely to agree to a bigger favor later (drive safely sign – experiment).

Consolidation: [#Wiki] Consolidation of memories occurs in two phases: synaptic (which takes minutes to hours) and system (which takes years). After consolidation, skill increases, unless an interfering task has been performed in the mean time (fast after the first task). [#Higbee80] Students remember more if a 21-minute lecture is broken up by three 2-minute pauses, to allow consolidation [same with self-study?]

Conspicuous consumption: [#HaidtH100] Conspicous consumption is like an arms race, people prefer 90,000 when coworkers earn 70,000 over 100,000 when coworkers earn 150,000. However, inconspicuous consumption (like vacation length), makes the longest vacation win, even if others have more. Note that money spent on activities tends to make us happier than money spent on material, but part (or all?) is because activities tend to be shared with others and improve our connection.

Constraints: [#EricB578] Experts, at least in history, are more aware of constraints in possible actions than novices. [#Adams55/EW] The pingpong ball-exercise with 'available tools' makes one focus on the tools instead of on other solutions (urinating in the tube). [#HaidtH133] People with fewer constraints, bonds and obligations are more likely to kill themselves (protestants more than catholics more than jews).

Construct: [#Seligm14] A construct is a sort of combination of 'real things'. Real things (like positive emotion) can be “operationalized” (measured). A construct (like the weather) is composed of multiple “real things”

Construction theory: [#NRS , William Croft] The theory that sentences are constructed out of templates [X gives Y to Z] and that a word had a defined range of places it can fill in the sentence (you can't say 'two wife please').

Constructivism: [#EricB82] The theory that a learner can only learn new things when those can be effectively mapped onto prior knowledge and experience. {EW: my 'scotch tape' model of memory} [#Clar22] Seems the biological way of learning, instead of absorption or behaviorism.

Contact: [#Franzen248] Babies 'manipulate' their mothers by grabbing them, following them with their eyes, and smiling at them into giving them physical proximity and contact.

Contact comfort: [#Haidt111] Young mammals need physical contact with their mother.

Contact hours: [#NRC020607] Hours in which a teacher is physically present. Since students will mainly study before a contact hour or an exam, increasing the number of contact hours increases the amount of study done, up till 12 hours per week (which leads to on average 35 study hours).

Contacts: [#Csik33] Some successful artists admit that they are not superior to others in talent, but that contacts and coincidents played the main role in them succeeding whereas hundreds of others could not make a living out of their passion.

Contempt: [#HaidtH60] Scandal is great entertainment because it allows people to feel contempt, a moral emotion that gives the feeling of moral superiority while asking nothing in return.

Content: [#EWL] What should people learn, for life or for a specific goal or profession? And what is not needed? [#Clar94] Minimizing content is a good way to reduce cognitive load. Remove unnecessary words, omit unnecessary technical details, omit unnecessary audio (though it helps in opening a session in enhancing motivation). Omit tangential stories and visuals, and redundant modes (text written out while you hear the audio saying the same thing).

Contentment: [#Kennon Sheldon, Tim Kasser, Developmental Psychology, juli 2001] Older people are more content, seems to be correlated with striving towards life goals, because one enjoys it and finds it important. The focus is however not on achieving the goal, but the pleasure of striving to it. Unhappy people focused on their own identity, to 'get to know themselves better', or looking for an equilibrium between all their different societal roles. Act more often out of guilt or to prevent negative reactions of others.

Contentness: [#Sidis] Being content makes one cease to notice the evils of life {EW: leads to intellectual stagnation, like the assistant professor, on achieving tenure, eating his brain?}

Contests: [#Colv193] Contests can help motivate performance. [#John46] Feynmann and his friend Walton challenged each other to solve more and more difficult problems.

Context: [#Wolt50] The context is often of great importance for retrieving memories; this can be place and time, things which happened before or after, as well as the physical and mental state of the learner. [#Wagn1237] 'Local' versus 'global' context refer to short-term and long-term goals respectively. Without the global context you may be doing the wrong thing, without skill in the local context you may do the right things in the wrong way. [#Higbee67] Linking studied material to a feature of the room seems to be necessary for the context effect of learning. Or simply try to recall the situation in which you learned the material. [#Adams18] The context is stored with the memory and recalled with it; first hearing violin music at a romantic scene may make it hard to link it to a battle scene. [#GR KNOCKDOWN IN NEWBORN DENTATE GRANULE NEURONS RESULTS IN IMPAIRED FEAR MEMORY  Van Hooijdonk] Normal mice, when exposed to a stressor, do not only freeze when getting the cue (this is coordinated by the amygdala) but also almost as much when exposed to the context (mediated by the amygdala), as if the brain thinks “better safe than sorry”. So context may indeed be important for memories, as it could be the context that is dangerous generally, and the cue may be harmless outside the context.

Context collapse: [#NS050915] Whereas in public life we usually behave differently depending on the context, online the aspects of our persona flatten into a single public face, which is known as 'context collapse'.

Contiguity (law of): [#Kluw3] The law of contiguity states that after events occur together (spatio-temporal), the reoccurrence of one event evokes the memory of the other event. {EW: formation of cues?} {and would this also explain the bayesian brain and expectancy?}. Blocking, lack of relative validity (that is, occurring together with a more informative stimulus) and contingency (does the CS affect the base rate of US appearance) seem to indicate that the brain thinks a lot like a scientist should!

Contingency: [#Kluw7] Whether a US appears more frequently after a CS, or with normal frequency.

Contradiction: [#Hargit170] It's important to find a contradiction in the literature [EW: so you should read and compare it]

Contrast principle: [#Influence12] If we see two objects/persons differing on one characteristic, we estimate the 'absolute value' of that characteristic as more extremely differing than it really is: looking at TV commercials makes you estimate dates less attractive than they really are, lifting a heavy object first makes you estimate a light object to be even lighter.

Control: [#Dwec102] Growth mindsets take control of their life, they don't sit and mope or blame others. [#Clar343] People will generally not work very hard for situations in which they don't feel in control (unfair grading scheme) [#Ster384] Dictature by management instead of involving the workers in decision-making. [#EW/Livius] Trying to remain in control all the time is stressful (perhaps because you know that you can't control everything). Going with the flow can be much more relaxing. [#NS270811] Feeling in control and an increased sense of purpose in life (for example, with meditation) increases the activity of telomerase. [#59sec7] People who feel in control of their lives are more successful, and more psychologically and physically healthy than those who are not. [#PinkDrive107] Perceived control is important for one's happiness, though people can differ what they most desire control about.

Control network: [#EricB660] The control network seems to be domain general, and be activated less and less as the task is automatized.

Controllable processes: [#EricB716] Focusing on controllable processes instead of outcome is useful as it makes people more aware of how and what they are doing than just the outcome.

Controlled processing: [#EricB269] Controlled processing results in explicit learning, can be modified more easily, but is also more influenced by stressors such as fatigue.

Controlled valence contagion: [#Nass138] Start out as sad (or happy) as the other, then slowly move your mood into the desired direction.

Controlling: [#Redirect34] Exercisers live longer – but because they also wear seat belts? You can't statistically control for things that we don't measure.

Conversation: [#Watt42] Is also a method to gain knowledge. In addition, it can give you new ideas, against the neuronal habituation of thinking only yourself on a subject. Also let your own striking observations be subject of conversation with friends (next to journalling about them). Having conversations with different persons, and not always staying in your own circle, is important. You can even learn things from people who do not seem as educated or smart as yourself.

Conversation with a time traveler: [#SellHuman92] Improv acting method: one plays role of person from 300 years ago – must explain modern concept to him/her {EW: useful for adopting lay person's perspective?}

Convincing: [#EW/vdVorst47] To convince people, perhaps make them curious? [#NS230612] Climate sceptics are more likely to be for measures if those are framed as making people more considerate, or promote technological development; instead of as the health risks of inaction. [#Catmul301] Showing works better than telling. [#NS141017Is positive thinking the way to save the planet?] Positive statements ("my neighbourhood will be a healthier place to live if we walk more to cut greenhouse gases") are more motivating than sacrificial statements ("I am going to have less freedom to make the choices I want if we are going to solve climate change). Feeling hopeful about the future makes people do more environmentally friendly things; hopefulness was more important than simple knowledge or altruistic values. Some people are however more motivated by pessimistic messages. Fear may be more helpful to spur people who believe in climate change into action, messages of hope are more to convince outsiders and encourage active people.

Cookbook experiments: [#Alch141002] Conceptual learning by students doing cookbook experiments is minimal.

Cooperation (and competition): [#Howe164] The cooperation and competition in writing stories greatly increased the fun of the Brontë children. [#Pers339] Co-operation seems to be more important than competition or individual effort in predicting success. [#Lieb39] Cooperating with persons you may harbor prejudices against will help diminish these prejudices.

Cooperation with God: [#Peal205] Ask God to help you with your problems, but also do your utmost best yourself. As the alcoholic said: when I pass a bar, I pray to God to strengthen me. I also run like hell.

Cooperative learning: [#Hatt212] Better than competitive or individualistic learning, but a combination of cooperation and competition works best. Cooperative learning not very efficient in mathematics or rote learning, good for reading

Coping: [#Mehr147] One can have a problem-focused coping style (directed at overcoming the harmful or threatening situation), emotion-focused coping style (emotional ventilation) or avoidance-focused (avoiding the situation). Problem-focused coping seems generally best. [#HayesS31] Most avoidance-based coping strategies are much more effective in the short-term than in the long term. Unfortunately, especially short-term effects get reinforced. [#HaidtH146] Three coping styles: active coping, reappraisal (getting one’s own thoughts right and looking for silver linings), and avoidance coping. Optimistic people cope by alternating style 1 and 2.

Copycat effect: [#NS230814DangerousWords] Copycat effects in suicide are most likely when the suicide is from politics or entertainment [EW: high status?] Note that when a 40-year old actress committed suicide, the highest increase was in younger females (under 29!). So mentor effect? Can be (partially?) prevented by not mentioning the method but mentioning a help line. In general, females seem to be more susceptible to copycat suicides than males.

Core narratives: [#Redirect9] People have core narratives, which act like filters that help or harm interpreting adult relationships.

Cori: [#John48] Carl and Gerty Cori were very good collaborators: Carl was the visionary, Gerty the lab genius and the person who read enormously widely and deeply and had omnivorous interests. [#Hargit163] Carl was a man of great intellect with a prodiguous command of physiology and medicine, an aptitide for chemical kinetics and chemistry.

Corpus Callosum: [#NS190113] Musicians who started practice before age 7 have much more extensive wiring and connectivity than musicians who started after age 7 (who were similar to controls looking at corpus callosum)

Correction: [#Watt63] If an author is obscure or wrong or discusses a matter too concisely or elaborately, feel free to correct him in his own book or your own notes. [#Evans97] Parents seldom correct children’s language use, which may also not be necessary as children are always predicting and listening.

Corruption: [#NS051111] Believing that others will check them and hold them to account may be the best deterrent for corruption. If elites get corrupt and competing, that's a sign of a state in danger of collapse. More audits work, as well as system that files anonymous complaints and sets up an audit after a certain number of complaints has been made. Also, power should come with more checks and balances, and powerful people should realize that even they are not corruptible.

CoRT: [#Ster403] Program developed by DeBono; does indeed increase creative thinking by enhancing the creative thinking procedurally, by adding tools to ones toolbox {like random stimulation?}.

Cortical activity: [#EricB661] Cortical activity on a task may decrease with training (automation, greater neural efficiency) or increase (spatial expansion, greater activation {EW: perhaps more links with other brain areas?}. In most cases there is a decrease, only at motor learning tasks increase is observed {EW: but chemistry?} Sometimes first increase, and later decrease with more training.

Cortical arousal: [#Eyse177] High cortical arousal concentrates ones vision on dominant ideas, low cortical arousal allows for more remote associations which may be more creative.

Cortisol: [#Time] High status people and animals (like alpha wolves) may suffer from more anxiety – higher cortisol levels, and even chances of heart attacks. [#NS031009] Corticosterone increases levels of dopamine in the amygdala, which increases learning the fearfulness of experiences. [#NS270514] If we have a friend with us, we get less increase in cortisol in a stressful situation.

Cost: [# http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/08/AR2010060800999.html] Paying with debit card hides the cost of behaviour, making children more likely to spend money on cookies than if they need to fork over cash. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201005/taxing-junk-food-or-subsidizing-health-food-new-evidence-what-actu] Considering the cost of something attractive (which usually would release dopamine/craving) can trigger the physical pain/disgust centre, especially if the cost is high, counteracting the buying impulse. {EW: so look at the price when you feel an impulse to buy something luxurious and unneccessary?}

Cost-benefit analysis: [#Strien218] Often an informal cost-benefit analysis is performed for every proposed new experiment, the reputation and successes of the proposer being weighted into the equation.

Costume: [#ChemWint06] It can be effective to lecture in a horse costume, to get their attention. Students have to like you and be with you.

Counterdependence: [#Hofste46] Some people in high power-distance countries reject dependence entirely, forming counterdependence.

Counterfactual thinking: [#Ster255] Counterfactual thinking ('assume sparrows can play hopscotch') seems to correlate to fluid intelligence as well as to creativity. {EW: would fluid intelligence be related to the ease with which one can avoid common cognitive ruts? And be able to be substituted by writing/putting things on paper? Or ease of keeping the premise in working memory, or active?}

Countering: [#Tigg163] Countering means instating a behaviour that helps establish the desired behaviour (for example, asking for time if you have difficulties saying 'no') When picking the right countering, ask yourself: what would I be able to do in that situation, and would help stimulate the desired behaviour? Countering can be by moving, speaking, thinking or feeling. Countering can be practiced by mental rehearsal or roleplay.

Counting: [#NS260610] People and chicks count from left to right, perhaps because right hemisphere is dominant in vision.

CPT: [#SteelArt] People weigh losses greater than gains, tend to overweigh small chances and underestimate large chances.

CR: [#Kluw16] Conditioned response; a response that would usually be a reaction to a natural stimulus (UR), but is learned to be associated with an earlier signal. Pavlov's dogs salivating when the bell rang would be a CR.

Craft: [#EW230612] Craft is not a science, but combining feedback and knowledge can help you hone your craft?.

Craftsman mindset: [#Newport100] The craftsman mindset focuses relentlessly on what value you are offering the world. {passion is what the world is offering you?}

Cram, Donald: [#Hargit106] Mother rebelled and escaped mennonite faith, introduced children to music and literature early on, and would stop reading a book to her son when it became exciting. Made his son 'pay' for food, dental care and music lessons by mowing the lawn or emptying ashes.

Creatine: [#NS130803] Creatine seems to increase memory/brain power, at least in vegetarians.

Creating genius: [#Hargit47] Advice to Chinese government: go to schools, find smart children, cultivate them, give them support, create the right conditions for research at the appropriate time, and letting them think freely.

Creative: [#Ster9] Students who are allowed to be creative are more motivated in school. So creativity may generate motivation.

Creative activity: [#Greene205] Creative activity is more satisfying than drugs or alcohol [EW: like my blogs for students?] Still, quite some 'creatives' resorted to drugs and alcohol as well – or were they creative due to this inner need?

Creative dynamic (law of the): [#Greene181] The higher the goal, the more energy you will call up from deep within.

Creative freedom: [#Ster342] The more central and important to a culture a subject is (for example, religion), the less creativity is encouraged in it. Sometimes only a specific group or gender is allowed to make changes.

Creative illness: [#Strien297] Some geniuses only break through after a period of melancholia, as if they have been searching for their life's plan.

Creative potential: [#SimonB176] Theory that any genius starts out with a certain reservoir of potential ideas, and then slowly exhausts it. Since some fields have slower ideation/elaboration (it takes much longer to write a novel than a poem), some fields peak later.

Creative visualisation: [#Ster204] Creative visualisation may work best when one is just playing around with shapes, and then tries to think of an application in an externally specified category.

Creativity: [#EW] Creativity seems possible due to three main factors: the desire to find a solution (how important finding a solution is to you, and how much time you are willing to spend), the knowledge you have, and how critically you evaluate solutions and if you dare proposing something. It may also matter if you imagine something lively (fire as hot licking flames instead of 'just a word'). Finally, creativity may be hampered by a desire to please someone and a fear to displease the same person – that does not lead to creativity, but to conformity. [#Root] Is seldom 'divine inspiration', rather hard work and much refining. [#Eyse37] Contemporary critics have other definitions as relevant, and tend to see things as not great or not creative which are judged by posterity as greatly creative. Creativity may also depend on the subject: scientist creativity seems more correlated with science word lists than with general word lists {EW:suggesting that creativity depends on the number of links of the 'cue neuron'?} Personality: independence in attitude and social behaviour, dominance, introversion, openness to stimuli, wide interests, self-acceptance, intuitiveness, flexibility, social presence and praise, an asocial attitude, a concern for social norms, radicalism, rejection of external constraints (and a fair degree of psychopathology). Can lack understanding of the need for social or emotional appeals to convince persons. Scientific creativity seems to be enhanced by higher theoretical interest together with higher aesthetic orientation. Simonton postulates that intelligence is the number of facts/connections in the brain, creativity the relative strength of far connections. The most creative scientists however seem to have an above-average hard time to find scholarships and acceptance. [#Eyse256] Creativity can not or barely be trained? Low correlation between dizygotic twins, suggesting emergenesis of creativity instead of pure addition of genes. Can be stimulated by giving children more knowledge {EW: must that be broad?} and diminishing the suppression of creativity in society. [#Robi64] Related to intelligence? People love the media in which they work {EW: so someone can love maths as the medium to work in? Or paint?} Fun is however not essential to be creative (there are enough creatives who were not really happy people). [#Ster64] Creativity can be enhanced with explicit instruction, especially for 'nongifted' people, as gifted children often use the strategies already. [#Ster137] Combination is often the combination of existing mental ideas {EW: so the composing ideas must exist in the mind (knowledge required!, and probably you can only combine pairs; three ideas at the same time may be combinatorially too hard} [#Ster141] Creative people may have a higher level of basal arousal (such as anxiety). Creativity may be a disinhibition syndrom, creative people have relatively lower creative as well as behavioural inhibition. [#EricB431] Is creativity enhanced by positive emotion? {EW: and idea generation vs idea choosing? Or is it a self-confidence effect?} [#EricB769] The ten-year rule also seems to hold for creatvity (at least in poetry, painting, and classical composition); the Beatles are an example too, the best work being produced after about 10 years in their career (after covering a lot of other bands). [#Busa168] Do creative people need something/someone to try distinguish/separate themselves from? [#Ster176] Creativity is almost never a purely individual phenomenon; in most cases, the environment needs to be suitable. Also: is this the right person at the right place at the right time? {myself in cheminformatics?} [#Ster207] Creativity can be goal-oriented or exploratory, but neither is 'best', it depends on the circumstances (how close are you to solution? Are some wrong concepts blocking your way, etc.) [#Ster216] Creativity is linked to specific domains, at least top-level creativity. [#Ster220] Creativity can be of different types: problem solution (the double helix), theory building (evolution), art, performance of a ritualized work (dance), and high-stake performances (like presidential debates). {ew: these are actually quite similar} [#Ster246] Creativity seems an amalgam of deep domain knowledge and general heuristics; without deep knowledge one would not know what problem was important, and be stymied by all the details! (and of course, not know what solutions are promising) [#Ster266] Creative students seem to fantastise with more playfulness – and more violence! (while intelligent and less creative students seem more eager to please) {hmm... creativity seems to correlate to more anxiety, but less eagerness to please/conformity} [#Ster400] Creativity in design at least can be enhanced with classroom programmes {but that may just be moderate transfer} [#C&EN030706] Creativity can blossom by praising it or paying attention to it, provocation (random word, negation, exaggeration, distortion, wishful thinking), examining assumptions, looking at how other systems solve your problem (for example, nature). Hiring people with a high Personal Weirdness Factor, picking diverse people for brainstorming groups, and not having a self-proclaimed expert lead help. [#Hatt155] Creativity programs work in making children more creative, though mostly through increasing motivation to be creative, not skill, though explicit techniques can be taught. [#NS270310] Low integrity of white matter (less myelin -slower [EW: and leakier?]), especially white matter connecting prefrontal cortex and thalamus, seems to correlate to creativity (while high white matter in prefrontal cortex seems to help intelligence) [http://www.wisconsinacappella.com/what-can-make-a-genius-bbc-horizon/] You need to be open, but also persistent, focused[?], no ADHD... [#Medawar40] To be creative in science one needs libraries, laboratories and the company of other scientists. Quiet life better than anxiety or distress. [#NS] YossarianLives may be interesting... [#Int08062012] If you encounter weird events, you'll be more creative afterwards [VR environment] – but would humor also work? [#http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/37392/EPS2012267ORG.pdf ] Hoever-Diversity & creativity: a team consisting of people with different knowledge and skills is more creative than a homogenous group, if people can view the world through other's eyes and give serious feedback. [#SimonKyaga] Relatives of people with autism, schizophrenia and anorexia have more often a creative profession. [#CreativityRon06022013] Heeft mindmap in hoofd, denkt heel snel associatief alle richtingen op (dus geen ketting, meer een soort boom die zich vanuit de basis vertakt. Volgt de reclame, krijgt e-mails over campagnes in de VS, vraagt zich bij elke reclame af wat de gedachtengang is, en wat het bedrijf wil bereiken met de reclame. Snel denken, snel veel ideeen genereren, 'pressure cooker'. Is voor Sinterklaas weken aan het nadenken in intervalletjes, heeft uiteindelijk misschien 10 goede ideeen en 90 ideeen al in een zeer vroeg stadium weggegooid (kan ik dit uitvoeren qua kosten/werk/tijd?) Ziet dingen visueel voor zich + eenvoud + verbaast zich erover. Meer aandacht (langer denken) Idealen Solon: In giving advice, seek to help people, not please them. Is intrinsiek lui (lagere school). Gaat ergens 300% voor als hij enthousiast is, anders geen inspanning. Beschouwt zichzelf meer als een bouwer dan als een onderhouder. Moeilijk bij brainstormen: vaak worden mensen uit andere afdelingen er niet bijgevraagd. Bij opdracht vergaart hij eerst kennis over het bedrijf (vragen: hoe zit het bedrijf in elkaar: missie/visie (de kritieke vragen), dan over de branche (nieuwe wensen, nieuwe producten), dan kijkt hij naar bredere ontwikkelingen, gaat associeren; niet in aparte tijd, maar krijgt ideeen bij het tekst doorscannen. Is heel snel afgeleid, rustige ruimte nodig. Moeilijkste is loslaten, uit je eigen denkkader stappen, naar emotie toegaan. Bewondert veel mensen, maar vooral ook mensen met lef zoals Richard Branson en Steve Jobs. Veel mensen voeren taken uit in opdracht maar bekommeren zich niet om de helicopterview. Veranderingen in het bedrijfsleven zijn vaak ad-hoc: idee is gemaakt, maar geen consequenties eraan verbonden – heeft geen gevolgen. Er wordt ook te weinig kennis gebruikt die er in een organisatie is (koffiejuffrouw, post-it). Spelen met woorden, woordketting; associatief gaan denken. [#NS090213] Sensory deprivation leads to phantom pains/sounds as the brain tries to predict future events when there is little information to guide its forecasts. [#NS271001] Creativity for logical thinkers (course). Techniques like making a sensible suggestion, then pose its opposite (pizza: no topping, sweet topping, cold topping) etc. Incubation is also a technique seldom taught in normal life. [#C&EN030706] Many process engineers did not consider creativity as something for people like them; were changed by seeing peer improving throughput by 30-40%. Techniques: pulling random word out of the dictionary, exaggeration, distortion, wishful thinking, writing down what you know about the problem and then throw out those assumptions. Metaphors (like earth), focusing on the result (getting the boat past the bridge – for example by sinking the bridge). Or hire people with a high 'Personal Weirdness Factor' who are not afraid to disagree with someone. Group leader should explain that he is a novice in the field but that he's there to empower them, 'being the expert' generally stifles creativity. [#ImagineXII] Perhaps creativity is aided by trying to forget everything you know about a process, act as if you are a visitor from Mars. Note that even consumers didn't like the idea of the Swiffer. [#6] Many people don't mention the part of the creative process when they wanted to quit, when they believed their problems were impossible to solve. [#23] The necessity of rhyming can force a poet to make creative leaps. 'Difficulty of task accelerates insight process?' At 3M, every researcher has to spend 15% of their day pursuing speculative new ideas ('the bootlegging hour'). Only requirement: share those ideas with colleagues. If people are happy, they are much better at guessing whether two words share a remote associate. Happy people solve about 25% more insight puzzles (usually accomplished after watching video of Robin Williams or such) {EW: rhyming heuristic: try make poem out of problem} Visual cortex activity drops before insight as well. Some brain damage can improve performance; III = III + III, 1 match. Brain damaged patients don't restrict their search to the numbers. Zen Buddhist meditators can turn into insight machines since they can focus on not being focused and pay attention to all those connections in the right hemisphere/ alpha waves; not paying such close attention to the words on the page. 3M also practices conceptual blending, moving its engineers from department to department; switch good people every 4 to 6 years. [#44] One other trick is to change verbs into more general/abstract verbs. [#56] Part of creativity is about persistence; not tiring while making things 'just right', like Auden lived on benzedrine. The purpose of delight may be attention. Drug-induced flood of dopamine makes even most tedious details too interesting to ignore. Nietsche: Dyonisian vs Appolonian creativity; flash of insight as well as hard work to perfect things. [#77] But negative moods help pay attention; make people remember better, write better. [#82] The art is to distinguish when you're hitting a wall and need creative thinking, or when you need to persevere and refine. [#109] We all have a drive to create, but the desire is suppressed by the timid circuits of the prefrontal cortex. Trick: Say: imagine yourself as seven years old, school is cancelled, whole day to yourself, write for 10 minutes – then give creative task. Gets twice as many ideas {EW: but is this just because you think of different situation?} Other trick, pose the problem as 'transportation problems of students in Greece (iso same country}' [#129] People who describe themselves as having multiple social identities (asian and american, female engineers) display higher levels of creativity. Different social identities result in different problem-solving approaches]. Being exposed to different cultures (and the confusion?) may help creativity. Or simple misunderstanding (the female doll in Germany). For criticism on your own book: try to get into the head not of yourself, nor of an editor, but of a smart stranger. [#222] It's always good to share ideas; ideas automatically inspire new ones. [#Greene195] It may be possible to look at an available technology, wondering how it could be used to address unmet needs. [#Volkskrant160913,CarstenDeDreu] After sleeping the memory is 'cleaned up', spurious data blocking finding a solution are cleaned away. [#Strien268] Strong motivation and drive seem necessary. But perhaps also the social context (resources, encouragement) [#Strien274] Even while grades of divergent/creative pupils were the same as those of the highly intelligent, teachers tended to prefer the conformists, the creatives were perceived as 'lastpakken' [EW: perhaps because teachers themselves are conformist? [#294] Both creativity and mental illness correlate with biological parents, not with adoptive parents. [#296] During a creative peak, geniuses can produce a huge concentration (Archimedes could work for days) Edwin Land, the inventor of the polaroid camera, would work for 36 hours without noticing, and then faint when he tried to get up. [#Adams114] Checklists can work: put to other uses, adapt, modify, magnify, minify, substitute, rearrange, reverse, combine, or p116 with stretch and such. Chronological record of problem-solutionis helpful, epecially if occasionally reviewed by others. Cramming all idea entries in the notebook the night before in the notebook generally helps students get good ideas the day they hand the notebook in. You can also formally establish a judgement-suspension session. Analogies (even far-fetched) may also help. [#Adams125] “Spontaneously creative” people seem less controlled and inhibited in their behaviour than average. Less afriad of ridicule. Also: less frightened by the unknown. May also be especially observant, value accurate observation more than other people do. [#143] Higher when either no evaluation is expected, or specific instructions have been given to attain creativity. Recognition can also motivate us. [#Strien30] Creative discoveries are usually part of a purposeful project that is usually part of a broader cadre. [#50] Can be trained by training to associate a stimulus word every time with a different word? [#62] Usually one has a problem, and makes a search for the right filling concept in the background, or the problem is in the background, and some stimulus provides the solution. [#Strien267] Not always clear differences between creative people and less creative people – apparently, one can be creative in many ways. However, motivation and drive do seem to differ. [#NS271001] Mindgym: make a sensible suggestion, then immediate pose its opposite (pizza with no topping, cold topping, sweet topping, etc.) [#SimonEdison2] Enhance Pauling's advice with producing ideas in lots of different areas, switching around from one topic to another in the most opportunistic fashion. [#SimonPhysicsOfLifeReviews158] Would creativity often find relationships between facts that were not yet explicitly linked? In that case, subconsiously learned relationships may enhance the chance of getting the creative breakthrough, and a kind of correlational analysis may be quite fertile. Would this also be one of the reasons that experience in the domain is most often needed? [#GijsScholtenVanAsschat-serendipityKNAW] Lack of money can make you creative [EW: anything that forces you to derive from routine or your ordinary plans can help]. [#Isaacson176] Patent lawyers can aid creativity by pressuring for more possible uses of a technology. [#Weiner25] Fun enhances creativity, money or evaluation squelches it  -at least for amateurs; experienced creators often do better when some money or fame is promised (EW: other limiting factor? Fear vs attention?) [#Weiner87] Priming people with humor makes them more creative. [#Weiner90] Can be enhanced by constraints? [#110] Cannot be learned as free-floating skill; it requires thinking about special content. [#153] Also primed by Janusian thinking (or at least overlaid images). [#Catmul152] When stuck, change mood (watching youtube videos, tell jokes, or tell stories of what happened last weekend). Later, once the mood has shifted, attack the problem again. [#Catmul212/EW] Would drawing negative spaces, which helps drawing, possibly also aid scientific creativity? Similarly for the pinhole (focusing on one detail). Postmortem and prepostmortem also seen as important for learning. [#SChmid29] May be helped by messy desks. [#NS240617TryAPowerPose] bobbing heads in time, and moving arms and limbs in a coordinated manner lead to more creative problem solving. [#Weiner230] Messy rooms help generate creativity. Changing scene, whether from town to country, into the street or into a coffee house, may also provide a stimulus for creativity. [#NS160917HappyMusicBoostsCreativity] Listening to happy music while working on problems helps divergent thinking (coming up with more unique solutions). Convergent thinking, however, benefits most from silence.

Creativity research journal: [#Ster4] Perhaps the only scientific journal dedicated to creativity, the 'Journal of Creative Behavior' being less empirical.

Creator: [#Ster221] Two axes: acceptance of ones domain vs breaking boundaries, and objects-persons. Acceptance/objects: Master (Mozart). Maker (Einstein), introspector (Freud) and influencer (Ghandi) {EW: cute, but this is mainly terrain focus; and a maker may just have more radical drives than a master). Common features: birth in an area some remove from a centre of culture, regular burgeois upbringing, strict disciplinary regime at home, moving to a major cultural center, discovering other young individuals with similar talents and ambitions, choosing a domain from a limited range, willingness to challenge authority, up to a decade invested in mastering a domain, a slow realization that current work in the domain is fundamentally flawed, exploration of areas that are considered dangerous or remote, feeling of isolation, and cognitive and affective support at the time of breakthrough. Tend to reflect a great deal on their goals, their successes in achieving them, and on the lessons learned from things that did not go so well. Second, they can analyze their strengths and weaknesses and leverage their strengths to the optimum. Third, they can frame defeats and failures not as occasions to give up, but as prods to greater achievement and situations where they can learn new lessons. [#Adamsxi] Most people are not conscious about how they solve problems – we have 'problem solving habits', and if you are unaware of your conceptual blocks, you can't solve them. Most of us are unconscious about our own habits of thinking [EW, well, unconscious thinking is hard to control. Conscious thinking?] [#Strien73] Transfer from army problem to tumor radiation problem almost only occurred if both problems were discussed in the same setting, or when subjects were given the hint that they could use the army problem (hint-nonhint = 75%-20%). Another condition was that the subject had picked up the essence of the army problem. At school, most students can't find analogies between different subjects – but creatives can?! [#76] May need a combination of playfulness and a feeling for the essential.

Credibility: [#EW/Dwec] Credibility can both be enhanced by giving examples and by asking people to come up with examples of their own.

Crick, Francis: [#NS090711] 'Franklin was too determined to be scientifically sound and to avoid shortcuts” “First class scientists takle risks... Rosalind, it seems to me, was too cautious.”

Crime: [#NS150613] Some people are suggesting evidence-based policing; crime, for example, is a combination of offender, victim, opportunity and lack of law enforcement, making hotspot policing much more effective than random patrols (after all, most crimes occur in only a small part of a city) Evidence-based policing matrix. For young offenders, a less formal approach works better. [EW: still you see that people attack the evidence since science is not perfect and there are many other factors, forgetting that 'common sense' is not perfect either]

Criterion-referenced instruction: [#Clar364] Giving feedback on performance relative to the objective goals instead of relative to ones colleagues.

Critical: [#Jaff15] Paracelsus was extremely critical of the doctors in his age.

Critical change agents: [#Hatt251] In therapy, the critical change agents are: knowledge and skills, a plan of action, strategies to overcome setbacks, a high sense of confidence, monitoring progress, a commitment to achieve, social and environmental support, and freedom/control/choice.

Critical period: [#Kluw48] Critical periods in brain development are followed by extensive pruning, probably making learning the particular skill much harder afterwards (though, I assume, not impossible, at least not till amateur level). Extra excitability of neurons in the developing brain may also result in faster learning. [#NS250513] However, Chinese and Hispanic immigrants show no sudden, just a gradual decline with English language skills on age of immigration (EW: can of course reflect interindividual differences in critical period averaged out over hundreds of thousands of people, but still makes you think...)

Critical thinking: [#Zill125] In talk-shows at least, critical thinking seems to correlate to emotional involvement.

Criticism: [#Ster64] Constructive criticism on solutions makes the critics like them better; critical criticism makes the critics more original. Even then, the differences are not very large. Other study finds that the constructive critics may be better at a task, perhaps especially when the problem to be solved lies in the interest area of the problem solvers. [#Franzen244] People who are excessively negatively criticised in their childhood become as adults more eager to be accepted by others, react more defensively to criticism, and avoid situations in which they will be evaluated. People who don't feel as eager to be accepted can endure much criticism without their happiness suffering from it. [#Hargit65] Curl was the 'designated worrier' on the fullerene project, making sure the others were not screwing up. [#Nass30] While praise is lapped up regardless of source and accuracy, people only adjust their self-esteem if criticism seems accurate (so no calumny. However, criticism and calumny are equally detrimental to the evaluator. When a newspaper reports A criticizing B, people develop negative feelings about A, B, and the newspaper. [in contrast, praise, flattery, and repetition of other's praising remarks all benefit the praiser] Destroys memory of whatever was before criticism due to taking too many cognitive resources (retroactive interference). But information that follows after is remembered better – proactive enhancement. So for criticism: first a few brief negative points, then positive remarks that are extremely detailed and specific, otherwise they won't be remembered (we have a bad memory for praise). [#Nass35] Criticism activates the fight-flight response, so can make people afraid or livid. Not emotions conductive to performance improvement. [#Nass36] Criticism only works if you have/get a clear idea on how to act on that information. Go deep rather than broad – a long lists of complaints makes it unclear where to begin, and retroactive interference. Also give people a chance to react on you, don't tell them to sleep on it. Though adrenalin is too strong. Instead, allow brief response and schedule follow-up session. [#Nass47] Criticising others may make you seem less likeable but more intelligent. [#Catmul141] Don’t criticize roughshod, every idea needs protection, at least at the start. [#Stalla66] Don’t criticize excessively. [#Markus9] For Americans), criticism seems to reduce effort, praise increases it (students want to excel, have something they are good at!). For Japanese students, praise decreases effort, criticism increases it, as students want to be average [EW: kind of like the energy label experiment]

Critics: [#Pau] Your critics care for you. {EW: if they're your supervisor, they occasionally also care for themselves – learn to see the difference} Criticism is best when it describes what you did, and why it is not so good for you/others {and perhaps ways to improve it? Or would that diminish responsibility of persons?} [#Howe125] Criticism can be paralyzing, James Mill wisely decided not to look into his son's 'histories' he wrote for pleasure.

Cross-fields: [#Ster248] An engineer recognized why kidney tubules were so long (which puzzled doctors into thinking they must be an artifact of evolution), because he was familiar with concentrator loops. For him, it was just pattern-recognition. Perhaps the fresh perspective from one field (or the patterns known in one field) can applied more often.

Cross-referencing: [#EricB378] The best programmers move backward and forward between problem domain and code domain; worse programmers are stuck in one mode. {EW: can this be extrapolated to other types of expertise? Goals-means crossover = monitoring?}

Cross-training: [#NS160213] Cross-training: team members work more effectively if they swap roles in preparation for a task; will converge on shared plan to complete the task, leading to fewer errors on the day. [#SimonB88] Staying too long in one domain can be counterproductive (overtraining), doing some 'cross-training' (studying different fields) can be useful.

Crossover: [#Robi78/EW] Some people are successful because they have an unconventional background for their job, like Ridley Scott, director, who has been trained as an artist. [#EricB774] Calder was inspired by Mondrian to make his wire figures abstract instead of representing distinct animals and people. [#NS14072012] A crossover idea: combining a metal core with a surrounding protein for even better catalysis.

Crowding-out effect: [#Pers131] Often, having no incentives or high incentives is better than having intermediate incentives, as offering extrinsic rewards can reduce motivation unless extremely high.

Crowds: [#Sommers55] Even imagining a crowd shortens people's reaction times to 'unaccountable' and 'exempt' [EW: but of themselves, or others?]. Also pledged smaller donations to charity after imagining a crowd. [#85] Crowds can also be 'read' (Cameron Hughes), is also essential since you need to know when they are ready. {not the same as reading individuals, but crossover skill useful for dating}

Crying: [#NS270216] The more masculine someone is perceived to be, the more appropriate to the situation tears were considered to be. Note that female cryers are nevertheless more likely to be comforted. Tears make faces look more masculine, and younger. For men, showing intense yet controlled emotion makes one seem more competent than if one does not show any emotion at all. Tears are also perceived as more positive if something is considered to be important, and not your fault. Status 'earns' you the right to cry.

CS: [#Kluw7] Conditioned Stimulus, or the stimulus that occurs first in learning experiments (the second stimulus is the US)

Cube model: [#EW] Optimal creative achievement may well be reached by a combination of high intelligence, reasonably high creativity (related to schizophrenic tendencies) as well as a small amount of autism helping to keep a relatively narrow focus.

Cue: [#Wolt48] There is always a cue that prompts us to get information from memory {EW: that prompt may be internal, as in creativity?} {may just be that activating one neuron may activate the rest of the network, especially when two or three neurons are initially activated which are in the same network}

Cultural bias: [#Hofste31] Cultural bias in the questions asked has quite a big influence in psychology and sociology; asking people of different nations/classes to come up with questions works better than the traditional ‘lead researcher’  can.

Cultural blocks: [#Adams54] Taboos, 'fantasy and reflection are lazy/crazy/a waste of time/', playfulness is for children only, problem-solving is serious business - humor out of place, feeling, intuition is bad, tradition preferable to change, any problem can be solved by scientific thinking and lots of money. In themselves, taboos not harmful when just imagined (and may lead to better solutions). Anyway, people can fantasize much more easily in a supportive environment. People feel guilty about fantasizing if it is not part of a assignment or 'goal'. For men: everything that seems 'feminine' (like intuition or imagination). Simlar for 'left-handed thinking' (feelings and beauty and such – would thinking of beauty work?). Love for tradition can counteract creativity since you must feel a need, an impetus, for change. We often follow rules (no matter how irrelevant), while it is the result that counts (learned at school and in games?). Being from a culture with less experience with machines makes people more inhibited in working with them.

Cultural mixing: [#Ster319] Places where many different cultures mix are liable to be more creative, since more different memes are available for recombination.

Culture shock: [#Hofste323] After culture shock there is a stable state, which may be higher or lower than stable state in previous country. Note that length of culture shock seems to adapt to length of stay. For every new environment, a new shock. Environment will generally first feel curiosity, then ethnocentricity, as the newcomer will seem rude and stupid. If enough foreigners come: polycentrism, judging others by the standards of others. Note that jokes are taboo until you know a lot about the other person’s culture. Note that integration leads to better adaptation than assimilation. Adaptation takes three generations. Joint venture better if management comes from only one part.  Expatriate boss important to be there for training of expatriate. Note that people with unduly inflated egos, a low tolerance for uncertainty, a history of emotional instabilitym or known racist or extreme right/left wing sympathies not very suited for expatriation. Chief problem of expatriates is lack of understanding and support of the persons who are not expatriated themselves.

Cum laude: [#NRC050711] Almost all thesis 'cum laude' are for men.

Curating: [#SellHuman148] To become an expert in something, make a lists of sources, scan at least 15 minutes, at least 2 times per day. Then (every day) make a list of annotated web links or maintain your own blog. Share: when you have enough information, share it with your colleagues, prospects, or entire social network. Www.bethkanter.org (curation primer).

Curie: [#John39] Pierre Curie was a very good experimenter and thinking, Marie was someone who took immediate action. Introverted and cautious versus socially skilled and active. Had different disciplinary training (physics versus chemistry). Bound together by a shared passion for scientific work. [#Jaff185] Maria had as role models her father, Newton, and Carl Friedrich Gauss. [#Crop295] Marie was unstoppable in any task she undertook, no matter what the obstacles. 'First principle: never let one's self be beaten down by obstacles or events'. Loved scientific duties, detested fund-raising and public relations. Father was professor in secondary school, but was demoted due to differences with his Russian superiors {so also an 'inconvenient' person}. Father had apparently great memory, and enjoyed any explanation he could give about nature and her ways. Mother had exceptional personality and moral authority, was also teacher and became headmistress. Loss of mother at age 11 threw Maria in a depression. Maria was a great student (finished first in the Sorbonne, of 1825 students). Because father was poor, entered pact with elder sister that Maria would get job as governess, and support her sister's study. Was able to come to Paris in the end, though was a bit too introverted for her brother-in-law. Pierre was great at designing apparatus, but a loner. Generally hesitated (except when wooing Marie). Had worked together with his brother. Did have vacations (Pierre was an avid naturalist, inspired by his family/father), but not much social life outside family gatherings and scientific meetings. Helped France during WWI by spreading the use of X-rays, becoming an X-ray nurse herself, and outwitting the French bureaucracy. Got own lab, though was imperious boss with preference for women and Poles. But could listen well and suggested experiments, was great laboratory director, and even willing to travel and do PR to help her cause. Worked in chemical lab of cousin when she was little, Mendeleev knew her father, predicted her a great future if she were to go into chemistry. Read with her father the polish classics, and memorized long pieces to recite to him. Did not fear the Russians (much), was quite fanatic.Asked prof Schutzenberger to be allowed to work next to Paul in the laboratory (so was not afraid to ask). Becquerel knew Marie and knew she was a gifted experimentator, and asked her to look into the uranium-salts. Borrowed the money for the research [Marie: unstoppable!] Pierre's father helped with Irene, so Marie could fully throw herself on her research. Marie fell ill twice. For last separations asked help from Belmont, head of separations. Then studied all possible properties of the new element, then wrote her PhD-thesis, as that was necessary for a career. Had rather sober interior {no waste of effort or money?} Saw benefit to humanity as greatest good, and refused to patent their invention {idealists?} Not a great orator, more precise and factual. Did not go to opera or theatre {O, but C overruled that?}

Curiosity: [#Howe14] Geniuses are almost universally intensely curious. {desire to collect data – out of obsessiveness, or extra reward, or because they live in a puzzling world?}[#Watt55] Curiosity in young people should be indulged and gratified, rather than frowned upon and restrained. [#EW] Curiosity may be adaptive in a complex yet not too-dangerous world (if the world is perceived as too dangerous, one may see autism-like stress symptoms) [#Crop205] According to Einstein, curiosity not only needs stimulation, but also a lot of freedom. [#Stol71] Ideally, training activities should invoke curiosity – that is, not telling everything at once; though the learner should not be confused. <EW> Curiosity is the process in which the mind seeks missing information that seems important. If a situation is important (so vivid, people, important consequences) the human mind will try find out what is missing to complete the picture. <EW: see also gap-theory (SUCCES)> [#Vorst10/EW] Curiosity is both something caused by uncertainty (what IS that? What is going to happen; can also be caused by deliberate hiding of something), as by social example (others are watching as well; so it must be important/interesting), and, likely, lack of stress/hurry. [uncertainty + importance] Was not always encouraged, especially by people in power [as it is the opposite of obedience and self-discipline]. And having enough flanking information is necessary to get interested in the hole (knowing 14 ministers versus 2) You get more curious when you are asked a question. Is it caused by having two (independent) properties of being open to new things and to desiring to understand? [#Franzen239] Curiosity may be caused less by the expected pleasure of learning new things, but more by the aversion of not knowing; like after coitus, most people feel a tad disappointed when their curiosity is satiated. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2012/gezien-met-mri-scan-nieuwsgierigheid-stimuleert-het-geheugen.html?utm_source=120214-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=gezien-met-mri-scan-nieuwsgierigheid-stimuleert-het-geheugen&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Curiosity stimulates the brain parts that are involved in processing unpleasant stimuli, like pain, mistakes, loss and insecurity; however seeing the correct picture (instead of an unrelated picture) lead to activation of the reward areas of the brain. Also improves hippocampus, and therefore stimulates memory. The more curious people are, the better they remember. [#Imagine236] /NOCCA/ If you act like a teacher “if you do this, this will happen”, curiosity will not be so great as if the teacher acts surprised upon discovering what happens.

Current understanding: [#Hatt44] Programs that address student's current understanding are much more powerful than programs that aim to give scientifically accurate data.

Cutler, Ann: [#Busa113] Neurolinguist, famous professor. Does not have children. Was top of class at school (parents expected it), but was gripped by language. Read enormous amounts. Had very good teachers, some even with PhD. Loved imitating accents. Was advised to seek another study after revealing that a famous historian had 'massaged' quotes. Read a book on psycholinguistics by accident, and was gripped by it. There was no psycholinguistics in Australia, but she found (coincidence?) a postdoc who referred her to the USA. Considers much of her skill not getting ideas, but designing elegant and unambiguous experiments {problem finding?} In general enjoys her successes, though is rather accepting of having to rewrite articles many times.

Cybernetics: [#EW] From the classical greek word for “navigator”. Roughly, cybernetics means that as long as the current input is not the same as the desired input, an agent should adjust its behaviour. Performance increases with the amount of control over the behaviour, the immediacy of feedback (if feedback is slow relative to performance the system tends to 'overshoot', rather like the spice industry in Ambon) and how well the system can distinguish between desired an undesired states.

Cycling: [#Greene189] Ideally you continually cycle between speculation and obvservation/experiment, to probe deeper and deeper into reality.

Da Vinci, Leonardo: [#Greene22] Was born out of wedlock, was therefore banned from attending university. Father was notary (so Leonardo has kind of middle-class background and access to lots of paper!) Had huge interest in detail, wanted to make realistic angelic wings, visited church to find a devoted expression, and experimented with paints until the effect seemed radiant. Could become obsessed with things (like birds) – perhaps through close study? Did not like politics or 'slijmen' to rich people. Found that his mind worked best when he had several different projects in hand, allowing him to build all kinds of connections between them. Had a reputation to be a slow worker, but found it more important to improve his skills than to be a mass producer. Cared less about the finished product than about the search and the process of creating something, which excited him.[#192] Engaged in obsessive studies of details. [#290] Was taught by great artist Verrochio, Verrochio trained pupils to make them reproduce folds of cloth realistically. Da Vincu had exceptional eye for detail. DV experimented with multiple layers and different pigments. Also must have had incredible patience. Exercised sketching faces of people in the street; doing at it different times a day to see the effect of light on the features. [#293] Leonardo hated high 'productivity' of other artists, sketching bright juxtapositions to superfically excite viewers and ignore details. So see something you produce – have eye for details, have life and presence of its own [EW: true or false? Shakespeare?] [#Weiner114] Stayed relatively long at Verroccio's workshop – because he had little social/political skill to get assignments, and had kind of renaissance ADD- leaving projects before they were finished. [perhaps also was neurotic, notebooks full of debilitating doubt, and expressions that he had not achieved anything]

Dailies: [#Catmul193] Together review work.

Daily practice: [#Bloo480] Parents insisting on daily practice may have helped top pianists form good habits, whether they as children liked the lessons or not.

Daily review: [#Watt34] Every day, consider your progress in learning.

Dalton: son of (poor[EW?]) weaver, tried establish a school in his village at age 12. Was fascinated by mathematical problems and by the weather, made loads of observations from them, even made his own hygrometer. Left (as a lector) the university of Manchester since it didn't leave him enough time for his meteorological observations. Even traveled over all of England and climbed mountains to do his observations. Daily (also had Thursday ritual of bowling, and jotting down his wins and losses) Eagerness to systematize? Fascination with weather led him to think about the debate of gases in the atmosphere (?beachhead principle?). Made drawings to help solve the problem (he'd been a teacher) His knowledge of the ancient philosophers and their atomic theory also helped him, as did his knowledge of the atomic opinions of Newton. ?Would he have been hampered by laboratory tests, as those were not accurate enough yet [EW: and may have distracted him from fast theorizing]? Was president of the Manchester society of Literature and Philosophy [EW: did this help his network? Or his inspiration?]. Was enthusiastic smoker as well.

Dantzig (George): [#Dwec58] Graduate math student who dozed off in class and copied two equations as homework, not knowing they had not been proven before, and solving them.

Dark ages: [#Simo205] Geniuses tend to cluster in time-periods, into “Golden ages” and “Dark ages”. Factors: domain activity, intellectual receptiveness, ethnic diversity, political openness. First of all it helps if before the time of the genius there is lots of notable activity in the domain and related domains, many geniuses have more than the standard number of eminent teachers. Too old teachers may hamper, and many geniuses have studied under teachers at their own creative primes. Diversity and youth! But Darwin also corresponded with many contemporaries.

DARPP-32: [#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2154393/There-IS-link-genius-madness-claim-scientists--dont-know-evolved-gift.html ]

Darwin, Charles: [#Howe27] Darwin was often anxious or unhappy {EW: high N?}. Encouraged his relatives to see him as relatively aimless and ineffectual, even if he at 20 already had the strong aim of becoming a leading naturalist. His mother started teaching him about plants. Was also sensitive to other people's needs, curious and enthusiastic. [#Ster438] Young Charles had many family members also interested in nature, and could easily find friends too with similar interests. [#Feistx] Darwin only claimed superiority to other people in noticing those things that escaped other's attention, and observing them carefully. [#Greene51] On the Beagle, Darwin had trouble at first fitting in, but then decided to observe the crew and the captain as if they were animals, and adjust his behaviour to fit in. After collecting the specimens, Darwin (who used to find all work boring) found he could work all hours of the day. [#Strien31] Malthus was more a catalyst, since Darwin was already quite 'warm': had 2 to 3 ideas in the years that he was working on evolution. [Also wrote diaries!] More like 2 or three smaller breakthrough for evolution than one big one. [#Strien272] Darwin himself assumed that, barring 'fools', differences in achievement were simply the result of hard work. [#Strien36] His story of Malthus may be a figment of Darwin's imagination, in the correct september month, nothing in Darwin's notes points towards sudden illumination. Autobiographies are notoriously unreliable.

Davidson, Richard: [#Davidson] Arrogant person, but more than willing to seek mentors and to collaborate if he doesn't have much expertise in a specific area (like infant brain scanning)

Davy, Humphry: [#Crop139] Lower-middle-class background, first assistant of apothecary, then superintendent of Medical Pneumatic Institution, his experiments because famous, and he wound up at the Royal Institution. (Davy was very handsome, charming, and publicly popular too). Very intense passion for rank (rather than science). [#Jaffe112] Worked so hard when he had discovered potassium, that he became very ill. Bragged a great deal [wanted to be admired? Narcissistic?] After marriage, did not care much about lab work anymore, in contrast to Berzelius. [#Greene98] Liked to talk about his ideas as they occurred to him and gain feedback from anyone around him.

Daydreaming: [#59sec80] Students, when asked to daydream about doing well on their exams, study less and make lower grades. Similar for taking initiative to talk with their crush. [#Imagine49] Daydreaming only helps creativity if you are aware enough to notice good ideas (Einstein's stone) [#50] May work best if you don't make a plan or list what to daydream about. [#NS160814It'sAllTooMuch] Daydreaming mode can be incited by listening to music, putting yourself in a relaxing situation, or engaging with nature.

De Jongh, Igone: [#Busa121] Was enchanted by ballet since she saw sleeping beauty on TV aged 4. Chose at age 9 the Amsterdam academy since it worked most closely with the national ballet (fitted her ambitions better). Considered every exertion, even the heavy ones, as things that brought her closer to her goal (others quit because they found it too harsh). People at the academy saw her as a talent, which made her work even harder (though others buckled under such expectations). Functions well under pressure, though there is an optimum (performance is better than repetition, but premiere is not the best). Parents did not so much push ballet, but did have the mindset that if one really wanted something, one should work hard for it. But was not motivated for the chorus line, wanted to be the prima donna, or else nothing. Sonja Marchiolli was her mentor and teacher. Loves to try new ballets, and loves the applause, even if her performance is not up to her own par.

Deadlines: [#ForsD89] Deadlines are often not very useful in goal-setting – if we know the deadline is just self-imposed, our minds won't take it seriously. [#Greene201] Setting deadlines can force our creativity to become more active. Edison announced something in the press, if he didn't work hard, his reputation would suffer. [] National Science Foundation/Carol Frost: without deadlines for grants, the number of applications shrinks spectactularly (with 59%), but the ideas are better thought-out.C2WLifeSciences200516”RustigGrantsAanvragen”

Deafness: [#Davidson163] Deaf people can't see 'sharper' than normal people, but if they're deaf from birth, their auditory cortex is recruited to process signals from their periferal vision, so they can detect changes in their periferal vision faster than can hearing people.

Death reminders: [#NS201012] Unconscious death-reminders increase our groupishness, conscious death reminders however lead people to re-evaluate what really matters. [#HaidtH132] When asked to reflect on their own mortality, people find the physical aspects of sexuality more disgusting and are less likely to agree with the similarity between man and animals.

Decanoic acid: [#NS281115HighHigh-FatDietForEpilepsyAffectsTheBrain] High-fat diets let the liver produce decanoic acid, which binds to brain cell receptors; this diminishes the chance of epilectic seizures. (A high-fat diet may also help against brain tumors).

Decay: [#EW] Skills decay when not exercised occasionally; a lesson in creativity may give a temporary boost, but may fizzle to extinction as time wears on.

Decentralized organisation: [#Isaaacson379] In a decentralized organisation, where you don't wield any power, make decisions like an engineer (Linus Thorvalds did)

Decision paralysis: [#HeaB50] More options, even good ones, can freeze us and make us retreat to the default plan {would choosing cost too much energy/stress?} Ambiguity and uncertainty (like in times of change) also lead to the same effect. Conversely, clarity dissolves resistance.

Decisions: [#Fors3] Most decisions are much easier to make than to carry out. We have a delusion of control. [#EricB427] Decisions always have ten cardinal issues: need, mode, investment, options, possibilities, judgment, value, trade-offs, acceptability and implementation. [#Pink42] There is not 'one homonunculus' who decides, there usually are different modules with conflicting desires involved. [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7351/pdf/474275a.pdf ] Humans, when deciding, give greater weight/thought to the risks posed by social agents (fellow humans) than to those posed by inanimate objects, such as nuclear power plants). [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201003/why-habits-are-hard-change-and-printers-hard-buy] If a decision is hard, we tend to go with the status-quo or do nothing {like the students who could choose between studying or two attractive events {EW: I guess we tend to be stress-avoidant}. If you go against the default, there is increased activity in, and increased connectivity between, two regions: the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and an area of the midbrain called the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The PFC is well-known to be involved in decision-making and self-control. The STN is thought to be important for motivating action. Apparently you need willpower and motivation to drive activity in the STN and override the default action. This may also be why simple formulas and rules for behaviour are popular. So for change, try change your default. [#Franzen161] Especially the anticipation of emotions is what drives decisions; whatever you expect will influence the effort you're willing to make {EW: so that's why introverts may be less 'motivated'?}. [#NS260512] When told that they'd need to defend their decision, people tended to make more irrational decisions (like choosing a medium-priced item) when that was easier to defend. [#Incluence275] If we're rushed or stressed or fatigued, we collect less information and go with 'natural heuristics' (making us vulnerable to sales sharks). [#NS160814It'sAllTooMuch] Try not to waste glucose and time on decisions that do not matter. If the decisions do matter, decide whether you can decide now or whether you need more information. [#Schmid147] For a decision, not just the decision itself, but also the timing (when the decision is made), the process and the implementation matter.

Declaration: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shyness-is-nice/201111/the-shyness-project-inspirational-interview-brittany] Brittany made a personal declaration, wrote it on paper, and took it out whenever she was doubtful (even if she wanted to quit many times).

Declarative memory: [#Kluw101] In learning, one often goes from explicit and slow actions (one knows every step) to automaticity, which is however often not 'verbalizable'.

Deconstruction: [#Howe67] George Stephenson liked to deconstruct (and reconstruct) the engine he was assigned to watch over. {EW: and Feynman?}

Dedication: [#Howe14] Most geniuses seem to possess an extraordinary dedication to their work.

Deduction: [#Ster137] For neither artists nor scientists do new ideas seem to arise from intellectual deduction, rather seem to appear spontaneously in the mind.

Deep learning: [#Hatt28] Deep learning is often relational (making links between two subjects) or elaborative (generalizing above the facts taught).

Deep processing: [#EW] Are autistics accused of just 'aping' the ideas of others, because psychologists think they do not use deep processing (finding underlying meaning and patterns?) {EW: of course, the psychologists I met personally were really shallow processors themselves} [#NS031211] When asked to give a definition of each word in a list makes you more likely to remember the word than counting its syllables. [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GrOxhYZdQ&NR=1&feature=endscreen] Deep proceesing of content: of a new concept: compare and contrast, analyze, make connections, think about implications, generate examples, link to personal experience.

Default mode network: [#NS281017Brain’sAutopilotModeLetsYouStopThinking] Default Mode network is active for automatisms, allows people to do things faster and more accurately than with conscious thought. (EW: related to ‘choking’ in sports?)

Deficits: [#Loeh134] If you shift your focus from filling deficits to cultivating deeper values and a vision for yourself, your life will be transformed.

Defocused attention: [#Ster139] Uncreative individuals seem to have a more narrowly focused attention than do creative individuals {EW: what does this mean?}

Degeneration: [#EW]  programmers degenerate if they don’t get feedback, either from experiments, from literature, or from people.

Dekker, Eduard Douwes: [#AO2153] Intelligent, but also neurotic, strong sense of justice and empathy.

Dekker, Nynke: [#C2W011011] Studied (also) at Yale, wanted to do biochemistry or biophysics, but at Yale your choice is still free, and physics inspired her. PhD in Harvard, where 40% of physics PhD-students is female.

Dekkers, Marlies: [#Busa37] Grew up in a very unambitious town, trying to learn was discouraged by her social environment. Had a kind of restlessness, too many emotions, was not able to go with the flow, needed to understand life. Made clothes since she was 10, that calmed her somewhat. Loved the first year of the art academy, but her fellow students grew jealous of the attention she received. Had 'hyper-drive', created 25 outfits instead of the required 7. May also have success because she also views herself as an entrepreneur; wants to understand things about business as well. Parents always accepted her, even if they did not understand her. Working helps to get the demons out of ones head...

Delay conditioning: [#Kluw11] Onset US exactly at offset CS; more effective than trace conditioning.

Delay of gratification: [#Marshmallow] You can often pick out high versus low delayers at age 19 months! Can that possibly be nurture? In any case, poor children are worse delayers than rich children. [#NS110616BrainDrainMakesYouActOnImpulse] As a person does difficult tasks, the activity of the middle frontal gyrus decreases, and the ability to choose long-term rewards over short-term ones dwindles.

Deliberate practice: [#Colv187] Sub-top skaters mainly practice the moves they already can, instead of those they find difficult. [#Colv66] Deliberate practice is actively designed to improve performance, often with a teacher's help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results is continuously available; it's highly demanding mentally; and it isn't much fun. [EricB14] Amount of deliberate practice is related to attained level of expert performance, in contrast to 'raw' experience. [#EricB45] Also has clear goals. [#EricB60] Presence of teachers, protected environment, opportunities for reflection, exploration of alternatives, problem solving, repetition with informative feedback. [#EricB307] High concentration and high relevance seem to be characteristics for deliberate practice. [#http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07wwln_freak.html?ei=5090&en=2cf57fe91bdd490f&ex=1304654400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all] Deliberate practice involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome. {EW: also on method, for example for talking to girls?} [#RoadExcel21] Well-defined tasks with appropriate difficulty level. It's not just 'practice', or 'doing something', but doing the right thing. Deliberate practice is also needed for maintaining performance! [#RoadExcel24] Concentration seems to be the key factor, at least in music (in sports it may not be), and teachers recommend the student to stop when concentration wanes. More sleep also needed (afternoon nap), preferably practice in morning, max 4 hours a day. Often a break after an hour or so. Could the increase in daily practice mean that people need to be able to concentrate for longer (which seems related to domain-age, not chronological age), or simply increased motivation? [#Newport77] Strain and feedback. [#82] Grandmasters score 5x as much serious study out of their total study time (5000 hours versus 1000 hours for amateurs)

Demanding: [#Robi171] Teachers who are demanding are good [Bloom]. Ken Robinson remembers Mrs York, who was a very demanding teacher, but a very good one too. [#Ster419] Environments which are both demanding and supportive are ideal for creativity; too much of one but too little of the other is not good.

Demands: [#Geowissen09] ? Scheicher got bad grades in school, until he became member of an orchestra where the director made very high demands. Started practicing three hours a day, found out he liked achievement and self-discipline, also started to work hard in school.

Dementia: [NRC120613] Diabetics have a larger chance to get dementia, especially if they suffer from hypoglycemia [which can lead to fainting, but perhaps that older brain cells die sooner if their environment is low on glucose]

Demotivation: [#EW] Demotivation in science can have many different causes, each needs its own cure. 1) frequent failure <study theory better, think more, or do something slightly easier for now> 2) lack of feedback, 3) demotivating/negative professors, 4) work not touching core values/not important, 5) lack of control 6) working too hard/forcedly, 7) not fun. [#Hatt48] Demotivation is usually more powerful than motivation, can be caused by devestating test results, public humiliation, conflicts with teachers or peers.

Dentate gyrus: [#Hooijdonk3] Part of the hippocampus, involved in encoding of spatial information and discrimination between similar contexts. [#wiki] Thought to play a role in laying down episodic memories.

Dependable: [#Howe30] Being dependable and helpful helped Darwin make many friends. [#Eyse110] Dependability does however not seem a global characteristic of creative people, sooner the reverse.

Depression: [#EW] Being depressed may enhance creativity, however being too depressed and becoming lethargic does not help {for myself: give myself a fun day if I feel really lethargic and underperforming} It is also possible that people prone to depression have a slight advantage in becoming geniuses, perhaps because of the higher problem solving capacity, or because they work to drive the blues away. [#Medi17] Exercise helps against depression. [#Dwec39] People with the growth mindset, when depressed, just work harder. [#Edu] Depressed people take the loss of rewards harder, have more distress. (even occurs with rats). [#Nett112] Depressed people have a lower volume and activity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is involved in suppressing negative thoughts/feelings. [#NS210511] Gut problems may trigger depression by releasing stress hormones. [#NS100710] The inflammation of depression may also trigger dementia later in life. {or is it correlation rather than causation?} [#SciArmMindNov/Dec09] Depression may be linked to sleeplessness. [#http://www.lumc.nl/0000/13043/13073/111212113015222] Women with a certain variant of the mineralocorticoid receptor have a smaller chance of becoming depressed. [#Franzen215] Depression may be caused by performance that is below one's own norms. [#Cicero23012012] Women with haplotype 2 of the mineralocorticoid receptor that captures cortisol (and hence a higher concentration of MR) have a lower chance of getting depressed. [#McGon215] Suppressing negative thoughts makes you more likely to become depressed. [#NS061012] Depression may come into existence through first a failure of memory to get specific memories [instead of general ones] + later stresses of life. {EW: would CBT help by training people to be specific?} [#Davidson39] Depressed patients have a dearth of activity in left prefrontal cortex or conversely have a much more active right prefrontal cortex (or both) [#Davidson82] Depressed people tend to lack persistence. Would depressed people also be less able to sustain positive emotion? Yes, because the nucleus accumbens needs to continue receiving signals from the prefrontal cortex to sustain positive emotion. Depression does not affect how high you get, but gives problems in sustaining positive feelings. [#Davidson153] Without a strong connection between prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, you are at a higher risk of depression. [#NS151212] Drugs that target the NMDA receptor can bring relief from depression in just 2 hours. [#NS270713] Depression may be a name for a host of diseases; often serotonin levels in depressed yet untreated patients are even higher than those in normal people. rTMS on left prefrontal cortex can help against treatment-resistant depression. Others: cranial electric stimulation or ketamine. Theory: depression leads some dendrites to shrivel, making people more susceptible for next depression. Ketamine blocks glutamate receptor. This leads to increase in brain-derived neurotropic factor that helps dendrites spout new spines. RTMS seems to do the same. [#NS070516PrimedForDepression] About half of people with depression have heightened levels of immune cells, and those people also show poor response to SSRIs. [#Lyubom58] Depression genes (in any case the short variant of 5-HTTLPR) can be activated by severe stress. [#Rosenb166] When you feel depressed, it can help to let your inner voices practice NVC. [#Rosenb75] Depression = not getting what you want? [#Lyubom273] Depression is more due to a lack of positive experiences than due to negative experiences. [#NS050817MensSweetToothCouldLeadToDepression] Men who eat most sugar will run a higher chance of depression or anxiety.

Deprivation: [#Ster328] While necessity is said to be the mother of invention, too much deprivation (or lack of time/too much stress) does not help either.

Deprofessionalizing: [#EW] When a government decides to spend less money (or arrange nationally) on things like healthcare or education, salaries decrease, and the job gets lower status, and fewer very competent people apply to it. This will generally lead to decreasing quality, which is counteracted by the government by imposing rules and regulations, which however makes the profession even less attractive to competent people, who feel (rightly) that their autonomy is being threatened. While the spiral may end at some point, it's probably in a more regulated and less-paid state than before. [#C2WMedicinesFeb13] 'Medisch contact': three quarters of physicians is stressed, work pressure 'riskant hoog'. Causes: lots of administrative work, irregular working hours, too little time per patient.

Description: [#Howe17] With a good description, the explanation is almost half-done. [#Weng18] Describing something carefully ('the Socratic method') is a great complement to Einsteinian visualisation.

Desensitisation: [#NS210407] Violent pictures become less shocking over time, and we become more tolerant of them {EW: also occurs with rewards or jobs? And is that why talents MUST always strive higher?}.

Desert-island trick: if you don't have temptations to resist, your willpower stays relatively strong

Desire to excel: [#Mehr215] A desire to excel was very important for success in Terman's study.

Desires: [#EW, econ-boek?] If people don't know that something exists, they generally won't desire it (such as the happy islanders meeting the post order catalog). Of course, even polynesians love 'cargo'. [#Franzen208] We often desire something simply because others (especially in our social group) desire it as well. [#McGon19] Without desires, we become depressed. [#Hooked] What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving (internal trigger)? What brings users to your service? (external trigger) [#Stalla48] People desire recognition (status), respect, brotherhood, manhood, a positive identity (like a hero)

Despacing: [#EW/59Sec31] Doing one act of kindness each day increases your happiness a little, but concentrating your acts in one day helps much more, up to 40%. {EW: why? Chore out of your system?}

Detail: [#NS..] Those children with extraordinary eye for detail are those that often develop into excelling adults. {so not 'good enough'} [#EricB177] Novices judge things with more detail as more accurate (this is similar to how we judge the accuracy of a memory).

Details: [#Strien125] Campbell theorized that creative minds have a much more detailed and accurate perception of things. Next to that, some people have a much greater and more variable store of concepts, for example people living in two cultures. [#Strien128/EW] Would masters in a field have stronger connections between potentially relevant data, like chess-players have? Or like scientists have larger chance to make the click due to a thicker network of connections? Sternberg justly commented that chess masters don't see more moves than normal players, they see better ones. And possibly experience would increase the effectivity of search processes.

Detector creation: [#EricB268] Brains creating functional units to respond selectivity to a specific type of input {EW: I assume they mean activated by a complex, such as reading the word 'and'}

Determination: [#Howe76] George Stephenson had great amounts of determination and single-mindedness. [#Hargit72] While Szilard tended to have an idea, patent it and move on, Lawrence was the person with the drive to see the cyclotron executed. [#Greene77] Determination may not be simply due to determination, but due to trust and faith, often when someone masters something that he or she finds difficult when he/she is young.

Developmental antecedents: [#Ster288] (Scientifically) creative persons usually have an low emotional intensity relationship with their parent(s?), parents foster autonomy, parental intellectual stimulation, and apprenticeship.

Deviants: [#Nass106] Deviants strengthen a team by making clear what is NOT the norm. If the deviant is removed, another person has his or her deficiencies highlighted and becomes the new deviant.

Devil's advocate: [#Csik122] Parents and schools should perhaps try to play 'devil's advocate' to change the perceptions of students, showing them real scientists who are enthousiastic, and real artists who are disciplined.

Dexel: mail haar, over motivatie!

DI: [#RubricViaWiki] Nothing presented may be contradicted by what is presented later. A lesson contains four topics that are unrelated or only vaguely related. What was discussed in the preceding lesson must be reviewed or incorporated in the current lesson. Lessons must be sequenced in a way that teaching time for the later lessons is reduced compared to teaching them in isolation. The difficulty of a DI-program should be consistent throughout. 3 to 12 minutes a lesson. Wording clear and concise, similar for all examples (though examples may be greatly different), must not use things that are not absolutely necessary for understanding the concept; lesson does not ask for knowing any more than has been taught in previous lessons, avoid unfamiliar abstract or complicated terms as much as possible, set of examples must cover as big a range of the universe as possible. If a task needs new vocabulary, set a task also to learn that word. Lessons introduce only about 10% new material, but additional practice on everything covered the last 2 lessons. Rules need to be simple: only one sentence if possible. Also be painstakingly correct (a verb is an action ? no, a verb is a word). Tasks should provide no spurious prompts [don't ask students what the verb is if the verb is underlined, if the students can't do it easily, faded examples are better, if students can do it easily, you still don't know whether they know the answer or are just looking at the prompts], there needs to be a sufficient number of tasks for a reliable test. Also no spurious patterns (like the verb always being the second word). Also: does the task teach and test what it's supposed to teach? Does something really need to be written on the board? (minimum of resources/time for desired effect?) Asking for a classical response is more effective than asking individual students for answers; you quickly know who is not up-to-date. Teaching should not interrupt a lesson: something should be taught, then tested; intermediate explanations mean that the order is wrong. Something that has been taught should either be reviewed regulary or become part of a more complex operation {and thereby rehearsed} {EW: looks like neural network learning; if examples are not diverse enough, and not many enough, overlearning may occur. Combined with working memory/distractors}Since you can't always predict where students will make mistakes, be flexible about repeating/varying the hard parts. Verbal examples followed by written examples {EW: may be more effective, a bit multimodal?} Sometimes it can be quite effective as well to teach patterns, not rules. Teacher talk vs student talk: whatever gives the optimal level of processing, usually keep teacher talk to a minimum. [128]

Dialogue: [#John132] Some people think best through dialogue (in contrast to those who think best through writing). 'Dialoguical thinkers' are often more social and willing to compromise. Dialogue is also useful in learning – if the other person can ask questions and give comments, it involves the other more than if the “teacher” is just talking and telling. [#EWL280613] Would it help to make a dialogue with Darwin or Newton in order to get their belief systems and perspective? [#EW/PeterZoeteweij] In contrast to the 'obligatory' scientific talks, dialogues may be much more productive, as they are interactive and the participants can steer the conversation to mutual interests – and even correct each other if they are wrong!

Diary: [#Howe58] Darwin had a diary, as did Gladstone.[#Edu] Energy diary helps correct bad habits (in energy use)

Dictatorships: [#AcadBoekengidsSep12] Dicatorships seem to diminish scientific discoveries, though they can produce astounding literature.

Diet: [#Hatt52] Colorings and such have only very limited effect on student's performance at school or 'hyperactivity'. [#NS211115] Your diet may also be influenced by the 'cravings' and chemical manipulation of your current gut microbiome. May be possible to retrain your brain by giving slowly-digested, high-fibre pizzas, so people feel full, but their brain receives less of a kick out of it. [interaction between hunger system and reward system] [#NS170617LowCarbDietMightMakeYouMoreTolerant] Low-carb meals tend to have high protein, which raises a precursor for dopamine, which makes people more accepting of unfair splits in the ultimatum game. (dopamine signals that people have experienced a reward)

Different: [#Robi78] Lennon and McCartney tried to make a different kind of song in every session. [#vdVorst60] Something that is different incites curiosity.

Differential reward: [#EricB36] People may complain of a dearth of teachers/engineers, but in general it turns out then that the salaries of those people are lower, as is the differential reward (excellence is not rewarded with as much more salary as for example for stockbrokers or dentists)

Differentiation: [#Csik158] Composed of involvement (family encourages activity and allows competitiveness) and freedom (freedom from chores and interruptions). Helps kids live up to expectations and pursue goals.

Difficult: [#Howe180] Even geniuses usually see their creative work as difficult and arduous. [#Hargit89] Ernest Rutherford had the dictum to never attempt a difficult problem, but that it was an attribute of genius to see which problems are not really difficult. The right problem is significant if you have solved it, and is solvable with the means at your disposal.

Difficulties: [#Colv205] Everyone who achieves exceptional performance has had many difficulties among the way. There is no exception. Do not expect the road to be not bumpy. [#Catmul318] A desire for everything to run smoothly is a false goal.

Difficulty: [#EWL] A task that is more difficult may cost more willpower, especially when it is not fun. If a task is too easy, one may however also be exposed to distracting thoughts. [#Kluw33] A task of greater difficulty may result in a more specific skill. [#Kluw91] A more difficult task seems to create greater brain activation. [#Nass43] If a task is announced as easy, people feel less fulfilled by the experience and feel it less enjoyable

Diffusion: [#McK] It is important that best practices can spread through a system (a school, a school district, a country) [#Howe] If you diffuse your energies too much, you can't become a genius as you lack time to excel in one area. However, for creative accomplishment you cannot focus on doing only one thing, as then your creativity suffers.

Dijkgraaf, Robbert: [#Busa143] Thinks you need a place to 'do your own thing' {autonomy}; considers many other scientists as people who have not really mastered their knowledge {no deep processsing?}Really admires people who do not rest until they fully understand something. Temporarily interrupted his study physics and mathematics for painting at the Rietveld Academy. Got very high marks at school ('tens'), but didn't realize things had something to do with the real world until he accidentally found a Scientific American; after which he read all of them he could find. Read a lot about physics in the library, but became discouraged at the university (low level, massal), but regained his interest when studying arts when he could choose his own subjects. {PAINTING! But also played a lot of tennis} Loved collaboration from his earliest childhood. Two, or especially three people with the third having been away for some time, works much better than solo work. Many of his colleagues don't read book {does he himself?} Dijkgraaf doesn't read much as he thinks it'll hamper his creativity. Feels when he's on the track of something really good. Isn't very competitive, once gave a golden idea to a colleague with 'perhaps this is interesting to investigate' {EW: though he probably also handed over much trash but doesn't remember that} Grabbed the opportunity to contact Edward Witten (waiting in a hotel lobby) {EW: Witten was his hero! Apparently, Dijkgraaf already knew a lot about physics and found it really important to have role models} Knows the place of everyone in his area, a ranking of colleagues is possible to the third decimal {Arne Mast was right!} Emphasizes the importance of finding your niche, even if it is a long and oftentimes difficult process.

Dijkstra, Rineke: [#Busa130] Dutch photographer. Mother was amateur-painter, but she herself, while she liked drawing and painting, did not excel in it. Then a friend pointed her to photography, {she went to a professional academy!} Hans Aarsman was her first teacher. Then studied at Gerrit Rietveld academy, and started working as a photographer for magazines. After her education, started wondering what made one photograph better than another photograph. Diane Arbus became her inspiration. Throws away lots of photos. Most important thing is not success (though that's very handy), but to surprise oneself with great photographs. Doing the best possible in your area.

Diluting: [#Watt133] Do not study too many different subjects at once, especially if they have little relation to another.

Dimensional thinking: [#Root03] Ninth of 13 thinking tools. Dimensional thinking involves making things smaller or larger {EW: similar to what Buzan does with E?} Also 3D->2D, 2D->3D, different coordinate systems which allow us to solve different problems.

Diminishing rewards: [#Tigg182] After a few weeks, as the new behaviour is more habitual and/or seems to produce rewards on its own, you can try to slowly diminish the rewards and counter-behaviour and memory aids. Measuring the behaviour remains important, however!

Diplomacy: [#Howe126] Mill complained that his father didn't make him very tactful or diplomatic, as he got used to arguing and contradicting people, which was encouraged by his father, but disliked by other/older people.

Dirac, Paul: [#Crop365] Had a misanthropic father, Charles, with little use for social contacts, forcing his son Paul to converse with him in French. Charles Dirac had also run away from home himself. Dirac was extremely silent: one to five-word answers. Older brother committed suicide. Paul threw himself into maths and physics, to compensate for the lack of emotional and social life? Almost never published with someone else or discussed his ideas. Relaxed by strenuous exercise, usually a walk. Dirac appreciated mathematics for its beauty, but distinguished beautiful from simple mathematics. Didn't like publicity, even considering refusing the Nobel prize to avoid it. Lucidity, sense of aesthetics, dislike for any frills. Was aloof from his children. Was, like Einstein, in his later years more addicted to mathematics than was good for his physics. Also isolated himself by refusing to deal with Feynman's 'inelegant' QED.

Direct instruction: [#Hatt204] Quite successful learning strategy (d=0.59) if the program of seven major steps is followed: 1) teacher should have clear idea what teaching intentions are; what should student be able to do/understand/care about as a result of the teaching. 2) What are the success criteria? Students need to be informed about the standards of performance. 3) build commitment and engagement of the students: a hook! 4) Input / modeling (teacher shows students what is to be expected as end product of their work), critical aspects explained by labeling, categorizing, and comparing to exemplars of what is desired. Check for understanding (have students 'got it' before proceeding?) 5) guided practice: students work through activity/exercise under teacher's direct supervision. 6) Closure: reviewing and clarifying the key points of a lesson 7) independent practice: rehearsal, and homework, or to ensure that the concepts learned are applied in other contexts as to promote transfer. [#RubricWiki] Axioms: what is taught may never be contradicted by what is taught later (EW: to minimize unlearning). DI lesson teaches 4 things that are either not related or remotely related.

Directionlessness: [#Howe128] Would JSM's directionlessness be a result of the fear instilled in him by his father, or of the suppression of expressing feelings? {no ambition? No private time? No stimulation of own interests? No innate enthusiasm for learning?}

Directive training: [#Stol111] Second of four training methods. Little learning control, but suitable for relative novices, especially when not much flexibility will be required on the job. Think of practicums in chemical education.

Disability: [#Hatt43] Mild intellectual disability or learning disability is less disruptive to schooling than emotional or behavioural disabilities.

Disagreeable: [#EW] What can I learn from a disagreeable person or paper?

Disagreeing: [#Catmul316] If someone disagrees with you, your first job is to understand the reasoning behind their conclusions.

DISC: [RobertoCortez] Dominance, Influence, Conscientiousness, Steadiness.

Discipline: [#Sidis] While discipline comes from 'disciple', student, in general it means that someone is able to do something even while there are more fun alternatives available. Second of all, it means that you are able to persist doing something despite initial setbacks and slow results. While discipline is not always beneficial (prompting some people to go down a non-productive road for too long) discipline is needed to make the great and long-term investments to become great in something. Coupled to regular critical reflection on ones actions, perhaps the blind side of discipline can be averted somewhat. {but great scientists? Do they also lose sight of what is fun?}

Discomfort: [#Coyl214] Lingering in discomfort a bit longer helps to conquer shyness.

Discouragement: [#EWL] Young chess prodigies are often discouraged when they hit a wall (they start meeting people who are better than they), and their sense of being 'talented' evaporates. It is much better if they believe that talent is just a matter of hard work. According to Ann, smart Chinese students go behave badly for the same reason. [#Watt131] If students try study things that are too complex yet for their level of knowledge, they are bound to become discouraged {EW: students who were 'thrown into the deep water'?} [#Bloo488] Top pianists were seldom discouraged by losing, as they and teachers reframed it to what they'd work on now.

Discovery: [#NS290912] Mesoudi (Plos 1, vol 6, p e18239) found that average age for Nobel-prize winning discoveries and technological inventions went from 32 in 1900 to 38 a century later. http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0018239 Also: hand axes dont have much room for innovation if you want to keep it a handaxe, more complicated things, however, are easier to change. Unless (like in Japanese samurai swords) production is so expensive that trial-and-error is stifled. Low population density, increased risk of group extinction, fragile networks for knowledge transfer.

Discrepancy: [#Ster173] In many 'talented' persons, there seems to be a perfect fit to ones domain, but the great innovators have an amount of discrepancy towards it, not too minor as to achieve little, nor too major as to leave the domain; but just enough to try transform it.

Discussion group: [#Howe99] Faraday organized a discussion group. And also a group in which he and his friends criticized and helped correct each other's essays.

Disgust: [#NS140712] Disgust makes us repelled from all objects in close proximity, even if they are not the cause of disgust themselves. [#Nelissen116] Evolved to protect ourselves from bacteria and viruses. Interestingly, does not seem to be present in most animals. Intimacy decreases disgust. Is partially learned – small children don't hate excrements. Also disgust for 'mental contagion' - we don't want to wear the sweater of a mass murderer, but do want to sit at Bill Clinton's bench. Disgust also extends to things that are very contrary to our identity. [#NRC290314] Lust can decrease disgust (disgust is actually a normal feminine reaction to the idea of vaginal penetration). Phobias often have a disgust component next to a fear component. Conservatives may feel disgust sooner than liberals, but it is also possible that they can't handle it as well, or that their thinking is more blocked by it. Females tend to feel disgust more easily and more often than men, and feeling disgusted bothers them more. [#HaidtH186] Disgust turns off any desire.

Disorganized bonding: [#NRC131110] If children want to go to their parents for safety but are afraid to do so, it's called 'disorganized bonding'. Very frequent if children are neglected or abused by their parents.

Dispositional variable: [#Eyse48] A variable like IQ which can be measured but does not fully explain something like real-world success (many people are very intelligent, but only few of them are huge successes), and can be described as more of a trait (such as anxiety) and state (such as fear)

Dispositions: [#Hatt40] The mindset a student brings to school. Some teachers think that achievement at school will automatically change dispositions (for the better), that is not actually true; dispositions must be addressed directly, or else they can hamper learning and achievement.

Disproval seeking: [#Hatt252] Not seeking affirmation that a method is working, but seeking for which students the method is NOT working, and how that can be remedied.

Disrespect: [#Stalla12] People who are consistently disrespected or ignored (in the workplace) instead of being recognized or shown respect, will try to get status, and, if failing that, get disengaged.

Dissent: [#Imagine163, Weiner171] Having dissent (a wrong name for a color), even if the dissent is wrong, gives many more creative answers. Perhaps due to surprise- you have to reassess your initial assumptions, so get a new perspective.

Distance education: [#Hatt233] Distance education is about as effective as being in the real classroom.

Distancing: [#HayesS53] objectively noticing what you are thinking.

Distractability: [#Dwec101] Pa Woods used to make loud noises just as Tiger was taking a swing. [#Imagine43] Really distractable students are also 7 times more likely to be rated as “eminent creative achievers”

Distractions: [#Watt145] Like the many Frisian olympists (and the paucity of Amsterdam geniuses) testify: being in an environment rich on fun distractions makes it much harder to concentrate the mind on (for example) study. As Persaud said: you need to behave as if you have no willpower. [#EricB396] Effective writers eliminate distractions from their environment. [#Nelissen219] A good mood increases distractability.[#Patter78] Distracting yourself is good to avoid giving in to temptations – distractions cause delay, delay reduces cravings. [#NS200517DaydreamBeliever] You can focus better if you give your mind more to do (deliberate distractions like background noise), bribing yourself (preferably with a bigger reward at the end), de-stress, sleep enough, and doodle related things.

Distributed cognition: [#vBru16] Distributed cognition always needs coordination (between representations, and between persons!); often there will be some redundancy to prevent errors.

Distribution: [#NS070913] The advantage of having older and younger chicks is that if all chicks would hatch at the same time, in lean years no offspring survive.

Divergent thinking: [#Ster217] Like ideational fluency, divergent thinking may be reliable, but not valid, as it does not distinguish true innovation from random rambling. [#Strien274] May be one factor that, next to sufficiently high IQ, leads to creativity. But may also need to be coupled to enough convergence, a 'helicopterview'/metacognition.

Diversity: [#Root] Successful scientists tend to have more projects of shorter duration and greater diversity; one correlate of scientific success is investigation of an unusual diversity of concurrent research topics. [#Watt138] Studying a little bit of diverse subjects may make you more broad-minded {and perhaps more creative}[#Simo211] Creative geniuses blossom better in time periods when there are many competing schools of thought rather than restrictive authoritarian systems without room for dissent. (economic decline tends to revert people to more traditionality) [https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3459] Task-related diversity increases productivity and creativity in groups- bio-demographic diversity does not. [#Int261012] Diversity of experience both works due to different viewpoints and because decision-making is slowed, making it more likely that errors are detected. [#SimonB146] Group members who are exposed to behavioural or ideological dissent are more likely to find solutions that are both novel and effective. [#NS080815] People have very low genetic diversity: the genetic diversity of all of humanity is lower than that of a small group of chimps. [#HaidtH178] Demographic diversity tends to be good; moral diversity bad.

Diversity of experience: [#Nels97] Having learned different programming language types, learning a new language type is much easier.

DLV: [#EW/Myst] People may avoid failure since that may be a 'demonstration of lower value' – however, avoiding failure at all costs may prevent learning. DLVs may also give rise to part of the Peter principle, and give rise to the preference for 'external incompetence' over 'internal incompetence', which of course would affect the social status of someone more directly.

Do something different: [#ForsD127] If you want to break a negative pattern, decide to do just one thing different next time. That will break the pattern.

Doctors: [#NS120610] Doctors need confidence, but it can reach into arrogance and feelings of omnipotence, which can be put to destructive uses ('When Doctors Kill'). [#EricPE2] Treatment by doctors gets worse the farther they are from graduation {EW: but is this because of forgetting or because of outdated knowledge?}

Doing: [#Root03] Most experts say that expertise comes from doing things, not from learning about them {EW: but imagining things when you learn?} [#Howe126] JSM thought his father focused too much on learning than on doing, so he lacked practical skills. [#EricB275] Is doing/action a necessary condition for implicit learning? May be though that it only works when also same motor actions are performed.

Doing well vs being well: [EW/Steel] Perhaps I should focus with Kai not on 'being/becoming'a great scientist, but doing great science.

Domain attractiveness: [#Ster320] The attractiveness of a domain determines how many ambitious/creative young people are attracted to it; it in turn depends on how central the domain is to the culture, the promise of rewards and opportunities, and the intrinsic pleasure of working in it.

Domain relevance: [#Ster217] Greater scientists are better able to sift what is important from what is unimportant in their domain.

Domain-specific expertise: [#EricB764] Domain-specific expertise is dependent on knowledge about a domain, in contrast to general expertise which is used in, for example, the candle problem. Which expertise is used in the great inventions? {EW: or is usually domain-specific expertise used first, then more general expertise if that fails?} {EW: looking at the case studies, inventions and discoveries seem to generally need a large amount of domain-specific expertise, spiced with a bit of general expertise when needed. Edison and the Wright brothers certainly kept up to date in relevant literature!} [#Syed42] The best companies in the world value not the most 'brilliant' managers, but the managers with most domain expertise – extensive knowledge of the company's field {EW: but deep knowledge may make one blind to major changes, even though it's probably generally good}.

Domestication: [#NS290417TakingABrushToNature] in virtually all domesticated mammal species, certain characteristics appear alongside tameness: floppy ears, star-shaped forehead markings, multiple breeding periods, and reduced, often curly tails.

Dominance: [#Mehr152] In general, having a more dominant personality is more useful than having a submissive personality, the possible exception is that a submissive personality seems to help networking.

Dominating thought: [#EW] Sometimes a thought must first be expressed in talking or papers before it can leave the mind and more thoughts can appear, the emotional tension being relaxed.

Doodling: [#NS221212] Doodling helps prevent daydreaming and thereby increases memory if information is presented in a boring way. For problem solving it may be useful to doodle about what you're hearing (spirals or flowers or such).

Dopamine: [#NSCoghlan] Dopamine levels increase by risks and novelty {goal directed – increases attention. May increase learning. Computer games – if no risks, boring!}, children with low dopamine levels therefore tend to have ADHD {and high dopamine levels? Would that predispose one to introversion or shyness? <which would be evolutionarily lethal for boys>} {or psychoticism? High P=high D and low HT} [#Medi81] Dopamine is released by the amygdala, using it as a PA uses post-it notes. [#Eyse153] Dopamine agonists decrease latent inhibition.[#WikiADHD] Very low dopamine may be related to ADHD, medium-low dopamine is however related to individuals with learning problems. [#Grin98] Cocaine blocks reuptake dopamine, heroin prevents downregulation of the dopaminergic system... however, long-term a downregulation takes place, so people require more and more stimulus for the same effect. {dopamine may be ' pay attention, get more information' , serotonin may be more like 'action, don't mind the results or setbacks' Exploration/exploitation neurotransmitter} [#Kluw238] Dopamine seems to protect coherent patterns in the prefrontal cortex from distraction. [#EW] Would high Dop help marshmallow test performance? [#NS070511] The DRD4 gene, a dopamine receptor, has different variants; DRD4 4R allele is associated with being even-tempered, reflective and prudent, 2R and 7R are less common (impulsive/exploratory behaviour, risk-taking and the ability to shrug off new situations), 7R linked to ADHD [#Int161210], but also to greater self-initiated sharing in young children [#NS28012012] Men make more dopamine in response to pleasure than women; [#http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028155.000-positive-feedback-gives-kids-with-adhd-a-head-start.html] Children with a long version of DRD4 learn slower than regular kids in a normal classroom, but even faster than regular children with a computer tutor giving (positive) feedback. {DRD4-R7? Higher risk on attention disorders and impulsivity, but perhaps more sensitive to (dopamine) rewards} [#NS061110] DRD4-7R: linked to novelty-seeking and sociality, makes people more liberal in outlook, but only if they have plenty of friends during adolescence. [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEMjploP3E4&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=3] If something is perceived that is rewarding, such as food or a mate, dopamine is released, hijacking attention and action to get it. Is not happiness, but wanting/craving. Promise of reward, but not reward itself. Bargains also release dopamine, as does taste of fat, taste of sugar, taste of salt, and especially in combination “You can't eat just one”. Increasing dopamine by free samples increases buying food, but does not increase buying things that don't increase dopamine, such as toilet paper. ALSO produces anxiety! [if you're not getting the reward, something is wrong] Mindfulness: how satisfying is this really? Do I feel anxious? [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201106/why-getting-married-or-even-shacking-may-reduce-the-risk-addiction] Less dopamine (as effect on addiction) is released in prairie voles in stable monogamous relationships; it is as if other rewards than sex with their partner lose their power {EW: relationship with dulling of faculties of married scientists?} [#Intermed181111] Modafinil, dopamine reuptake inhibitor, helps against sleepiness, and aids memory tasks, especially short-term memory. [#NS05052012] Dopamine acts in region controlling attention in easy task, in reward centres for difficult task (is difficulty therefore motivating?) <EW: WRONG! http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/18/6170 It basically says that individuals with a higher dopamine activation/(sensitivity?) in the left striatum and ventromedial cortex make it more likely that someone would pursue a big reward, even if the chance of reward is small. More dopamine activity in the bilateral insula however correlates to low-effort choices, as that may be the system calculating costs. [#McGon112] Dopamine does not create happiness, more like arousal, letting people feel awake, alert and captivated. Also makes you more susceptible to any other kind of temptation. Dopamine system also responds to novelty and variety. A rat without a dopamine system still likes the reward, it just doesn't want it before it gets it. Dopamine is for action, not happiness [..125] But also activates brain's stress center. It however works to pay attention to how rewarding something actually is. [#?] Dopamine strenghtens neural pathways of rewarded behaviour (or, possibly more precisely, all neural pathways that are active at that time). [#Nelissen216] Dopamin in cingulate cortex may increase our openness to experience. [#McGon115] Playing a video games leads to as much as a dopamine rush as amphetamine use does. Getting much more dopamine (like getting L-dopa against Parkinson's) makes you much more sensitive to addictions like drinking, gambling, drugs, etc. Generally makes you take more risks, and strive for immediate gratification. [#Hooked8] Dopamine surges when brain expects a reward. Variable reward: more dopamine.[#9] Produces a focused state, suppresses regions involved in judgement and reason, activates brain areas associated with wanting and desire. [#NS090716AHundredAndCounting] Dopamine decreases by 10% for every decade of life.

Doping: [#C2W-130213DopingVoorBetereStudieresultaten] Whether students use 'performance enhancing' doping depends for a large part on it being approved by their environment, yet only 5% in total. It helps that it looks innocent (a pill, instead of an injection), mainly done by badly performing students. Also, mostly are young people who also use lots of other 'compounds'. In NL just 1.7%, though Dutch doctors are also less generous in prescribing drugs. 7-10% in VS, possibly due to higher social pressure.

Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex: [#NS011212] Lights up when people feel social rejection; though social rejection also lights up the anterior insula, a part of the pain network.

Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC): [#Imagine91] Associated with impulse control, 'shut off' by improvising musicians. “Being in your head” by actors. [#Burkeman161]  plays a crucial role in filtering our irrelevant or unwanted information, like talk at a cocktail party – if it is damaged, such things give more trouble. But it is also active if something  violates our expectations, so may suppress what one does not expect.

Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex: [#NS021113BrainSimulationBringsSocialSideToAutism] dmPFC seems underactive in people with autism.

Double decision: [#www.postitscience.com] game might help (scientific evidence) speed, memory and concentration ability.

Doublethink: [#Syed165] A great sporter must both calculate the optimal move with its failure stats but then perform as if he were certain to succeed. [#59sec96] Best technique for achieving goals: imagine top two benefits, and top two obstacles, imagine benefit 1, and how great it is/how it would make their life more enjoyable, then obstacle 1 and how to deal with it. Then do the same for 2.

Doubt: [#Peal93] Doubt closes the power flow. {EW: or is it the stress of doubt, or lack of confidence in finding the answer so that you do not seek it anymore?} [#Weiner158] Doubt can either paralyze or embolden (like it did in Scotland)

Dr. Fox-effect: [#Int051012] A 'dr. Myron Fox' could make his audience enthousiastic with a really bad lecture by being vivacious, warm and with humor. Similarly, we decide on political candidates similarly as to when the sound is off, but also teachers who are expressive, humoristic, friendly, enthusiastic and charismatic makes students score higher than if the story is brought in a boring manner.

Drawing: [#Howe88] Faraday copied illustrations he found interesting, as well as copying text he found interesting. {EW: and according to Root, drawing is good for a scientist!} [#EW] Would drawing something, like the growing of the brain, be more vivid/convincing than just telling it? [Would 3D-doodle-pen help increase your creativity? [#Foer225] Artists first learn to trace contour lines and negative space, to learn to ignore/override top-level processing. Some savants may do that naturally.

Dreaming: [#Strien22] Kekule reported that he was falling asleep in front of his fire. Of note: he had had earlier visions of the dancing atoms, AND he was working on writing a textbook [so had refreshed diverse memories of his field] AND apparently was someone who was not so stressed that he wanted to continue working at all costs AND he knew his thoughts were elsewhere while writing the book (so some things were occupying his mind). [#31] Note that he had also seen the ring structure in other publications, but had not made the link yet. Seven years earlier he had a similar vision, after a long conversation with a colleague/friend in the evening, falling asleep somewhat until the conductor announced Clapham Road. [#37] Dream story may be fiction, though.

Dreams: [#Schafer35] Dreams and goals keep our energy flowing, it should never be 'later/tomorrow' I'll pursue my dreams, not now. [#Davidson16] Almost every dream contains very strong emotions.

Drill: [#Sidis] Drill is a way of training, to execute actions or a certain action in response to a specific stimulus. Some 'drills' are useful as shortcuts (9+9=...) however, the danger of drills is that people forget the purpose of the action, the why, and therefore cannot adjust the action to new situations or circumstances. The drilled action becomes a habit which limits performance (even if it may give greater performance than an undrilled situation).

Drilling versus digging: [#Hargit62] Do you focus on one aspect or do several things during your career? Nobel prizes have been awarded to both types {EW: perhaps that digging types also experimented a bit around for creativity and new methods}. [#Hargit68] Sometimes a driller wins the prize preferentially since he stays in the field.

Drive: [#EWL] Does the success of a scientist depend on how much he is driven by his curiosity and enthousiasm rather than discipline, his ability to do things he doesn't like and not giving up if it seems a bad idea? [#Franzen70] Is drive the result of an imbalance in the homeostatis, and can behaviour leading to a reduction of the imbalance lead to forming a habit? {EW: boredom or nervousness for me a drive to play WoW?}

Dronkers, Jaap: Professor in education. Contact? Onderwijswethouder Hilhorst is in elk geval voor versoepeling van de wetgeving van de uitbreiding van scholen.

Dropping out: [#Denktank] Many students quit an education before finishing it, both in MBO as at the university {EW: why? Do they lose interest, gain new interests, what are the causes?} [#Parr23] Main factors in dropping out are wrong choice of study, insufficient capacity, and problems outside the university. Secondary problems are personal factors, social adjustment, and workmethods. [#Hatt42] Dropping out correlates to IQ, educational aspirations, and locus of control. [#Eric1,27] Students who drop out versus persevere: perseverance due to support parents/environment, ability to internalize long-term goals and have short-term goals which make improvements in individual practice sessions meaningful and rewarding. Also the networks that a music student makes with his teacher and fellow students help the perseverance. [#NRC060214] About 12% of Amsterdam VWO-students has to get a lower-level diploma, 1.5x as much as the national average. [#NS130914PhoneInYourFeelings] Andrew Campbell used smartphones to check while students entering university with similar qualifications respond differently; stress is predicted by short conversations and disturbed sleep, depressed students are less often with other people, also have shorter conversations, and disrupted or excessive sleep, and lonely students spend more time indoors. As term went on, workload increased, stress shoots up, and sleep, chat and physical activity all drop off.

Drugs: [#EW] Drugs and smoking and their effect on brain chemicals may give insight into genius; for example, extraverted people create more dopamine in response to a reward; but this dopamine may not be in the same pool as the dopamine/serotonine balance in learning. [#NS280505] Modafinil can keep people awake and alert for 90 hours straight, without the jitteriness and bad concentration produced by amphetamines and even coffee. May even perform better than in their rested state. Ritalin can help with superior concentration. Ampakines may be able to make sleep-deprived or elderly persons perform as well as fit or young persons. {of course, fear that evolution has already optimized memory and that there may be unwanted side effects; then again, our current surroundings are very non-natural and recent}

Dual encoding: [#RoadExcel17] Chess experts must represent chess pieces in different ways in memory: a highly interpreted one to help memory and pattern matching, and a 'literal' one that helps finding novel moves. [#Higbee39] Concrete words and pictures may be remembered better than abstract words, since they are encoded both verbally and non-verbally.

Dual representational theory: [#Medi32] Humans have the ability to assign meaning and characteristics to things that do not actually possess them (pentagon = military?). Is not present at birth, takes about 3 years to develop (same time as theory of mind?)

Dualities: [#Greene245] Dualities can hamper creativity: don't think in terms of 'real' or 'unreal', but how those can be blended.

Dunning-Kruger effect: [#Switch118] The Dunning-Kruger effect, with its associated overestimation of performance ('we're all above average') is partly caused since we define quality in ways that flatter us ('I'm a great programmer since I make pseudocode')

Duration: [#Ster94] Many creative products can take months or years to be completed, creative persons need to have perseverance.

Dylan, Bob: [#Robi121] Always loved folk music and tried to find like-minded friends. Was enormously inspired by Woody Guthrie.

Dyslexia: [#EricB671] In dyslexics, there may be lower connectivity in the angular gyrus. [#Kluw20] In dyslexics, the timing may be off (at least when there is cerebellar disfunction).

Dyson, Freeman: [#Crop389] Parents cared deeply about intellectual pursuits, but did not visit him at his boarding school. Father was composer, mother lawyer turned social-worker. Placed first in entrance examination for private school, showed aptitude in languages, music, and the steeplechase. Went to Cambridge. Dyson didn't understand Dirac, Hardy was depressed, but Abram Besicovitch was friendly and encouraging. Dyson practiced 'night climbing' for excitement. Switched from mathematics to theoretical physics precisely because physics was such a mess at the time. Found Bethe a bit of a caricature of a professor, but was bowled over by his generosity and unselfishness. Became friends with Feynman. Was able to listen to Schwinger's lecture and see the connection with Feynman's theory when on a Greyhound bus trip, after not thinking about physics for two weeks.

Early intervention: [#Hatt58] Early intervention, a kind of pre-school programme, has decent effects on the later achievements of children (d=0.50), though it should be preferably be intense, given more than 13 hours a week, structured, and include 15 or more children. Note that the effect of early interventions is likely to diminish with the advent of formal school [EW: unless there is a Matthew-like runaway effect]. Similar, pre-school programs help; and daycare is at least good for the cognitive development.

Early selection: [#NRC, Herman van de Werfhorst] Early selection makes children of the 'lower track' vote less often, become less often member of associations, and have less faith in politics and society than if they have sat with smart students in the class for a longer time.

Early start: [#EricB463] An early start may not be possible for some 'adult' instruments like a cello, best you can hope for is transfer-of-learning from another instrument. [#EricB465] An early start may also give more extensive cortical rearrangement {though it is unclear whether that is because the brains are more malleable then, or because of more hours of practice} [#Syed58] An early start is not always advantageous; unless the motivation is handled skillfully, parents can easily push too hard, harder than motivation can be internalized; and the road is not to excellence, but to burnout.

Earnest: [#Pau] Being earnest (sincere, purposeful, devoted, determined, not concerned about unimportant things) is important, better someone who is earnest than someone who is 'hip'. {Pausch was dependable, like Darwin}

Ease: [#EW/Csik] Most adults prefer easy free-time activities over challenging ones, even though the challenging ones make them feel better afterwards. Would this be because the treshold is higher due to initial lesser pleasantness?

Easy: [#Syed123] When someone performs well without breaking a sweat, say that it was too easy and apologize for wasting their time, and promise/try to give them something that is harder and will really teach them. [#Syed152] If you need to do something so difficult that it is stressful, imagine a easy thing in your mind first, like picking up a golf ball.

Easy successes: [#DeMoor39] Lots of easy successes in the beginning may handicap people because they will expect success to easily/quickly in more difficut situations, a too-steep learning curve.

Eating: [#NS160416GetInSync] Eating main meal before 3PM is healthy. Also, restricting the time windows in which you eat is healthy(helps against obesity). [#NS060914ExtremeSnacking] Watching drama on TV while eating makes people eat more calories than watching an interview, possibly because they are too distracted to notice their calories [EW: or bodies more primed for action?]

Eating their young: [#Meda56] Some supervisors are known to habitually eat their young (instead of teaching them and helping their career).

EBCC: [#Kluw15] Eyeblink Classical Conditioning; a rather simple form of conditioning, which may not require the aid of the hippocampus (which seems necessary in normal declarative learning). The cerebellum seems necessary, though.

Ecological psychology: [#EricB514] Sensory impressions are 'mixed'- a hill is perceived steeper if you're carrying a heavier backpack.

Economy: [#Imagine240] The 5% of American workers employed in science and technology produce 50% of sustained economic growth.

Edinburgh: [#Weiner174] Edinburgh had clubs. [#179] Jovial atmosphere != docility. Also helped that professors tested wacky ideas on students (and were paid for student presence). Scots were also literate earlier than others, thanks to church campaign to get them reading the Good Book.

Edison, Thomas Alva: [#EricB780] One of Edison's 'smart moves' was investigating WHY the first light bulbs failed. [#Greene123] Had a relentless desire to learn whatever crossed his path, and lots of self-disipline. [#SimonEdison3] Had career peak age 35-39 and 55-59, big through in between... Most of his miscellanous inventions went nowhere, too hastily sketched, too few details (possibly too little knowledge about/interest in a subject). Worked on sound recording whenever he had the time away from more pressing matters, though oddly considered cylinders superior to disks. In general, his inventions were clustered, most of a 5 to 10-year period being devoted to a single core subject (though with some hobbies). And things went wrong where he lacked expertise or commercial know-how (like in mining). Did not really credit his co-workers. Of his 1093 patents, about 1 in 100 was a truly extremely creative. About 500 or 600 patent applications were rejected. Through in 40s may have to do with distrust of patent office and tiredness of the expenses and long duration of litigation, deciding that making things a 'trade secret' was a better way to make money from them. Could be very persistent, 'banging his head against the wall' with fuel cells, still giving himself limits (say 5 years) to achieve it. Would studyously do homework on past efforts before embarking on another big project. Had network of enterprises.

Education: [#Sidis] Education shapes the society, society shapes its education. {EW: since what is culture but a set of beliefs and behaviours ever imprinted on the children? Even though the culture of each individual family or school may be slightly different. Having the right beliefs may help people in a society handle life} [#Ster122] Creative genius seems correlated to less than mainsteam educational and professional environments. [#Mehr142] Individuals with better education have better health, both psychologically and physically. [#Carnxix] “Education is the ability to meet life's situations (former president Princeton university). [#NEXTSTEP2014080114] Even a 'huisarts', who is always an entrepreneur, is taught little to nothing about entrepreneurship at the university. Fortunately the Dutch bond for physicians (VvAA) helps. [#SimonB95] Geniuses in domains with more 'sighted variation' got higher grades in school, got high levels of formal education, and received training close to their eventual domain of excellence. Sighted variation: only one or two mentors, and those being fairly homogenous. Blinder variation: more mentors and role models, and those often diverging or even contradictory. [#EW230916] Most societies evaluate education on 3 dimensions: usefulness of the knowledge/skills, testability of the knowledge/skills, and costs of teaching them. Many societies tend to be “selection-based”, preferring to teach unimportant yet testable knowledge/skills over important yet hard-to-test skills. Though money generally also plays a part.

Education research: Campbell collaboration.

EEG-biofeedback: [#WikiADHD] Seems to help children with ADHD without medication's side effects. {EW: would biofeedback help everyone control their brain better and become 'geniuses'?}

Effect size: [#Clar45] Heuristic dividing the size of the effect (say 10 points) by the standard deviation of learners in a population. Effect sizes of 0.8 or greater rare considered large, effect sizes of 0.2 or smaller too small to bother with in practice. [#Hatt7] One deviation equates advancing children's learning by two or three years, improving the rate of learning by 50%, or a correlation r of about 0.50, or exceed 84% of students not receiving the treatment. Similar to difference between 1m60 and 1m83, and IQ of average high school student and PhD graduates. Note that small effect sizes can still be attractive if they can be achieved cheaply, as they can add up, and large effect sizes may be great but too expensive in practice.

Effective learners: [#EricsD433] Effective learners read books, seek help from others, try on new ideas, and experiment with their environment. Even Tiger Woods once hired a coach to help him rebuild his swing.

Effectiveness: [#Redirect29] Participants in a study skills programme actually did not have any beter study skills after the program than before, still they felt improvement as they mistakenly remembered their study skills to be much worse before that time. Wilson therefore advocates a “don't ask, can't tell”-policy: people can be good at indicating their feelings, which is valuable, but finding facts or causes for feelings by asking people is iffy at best.

Efficiency: [#Catmul134] Striving for efficiency or better pipelines can be dangerous, it can supplant real reason to wqork, to make something great.

Effort: [#Dwec58] Fixed-mindset students typically show low effort to protect their egos. [#NS311211] Things that are more difficult to get or to do are more desirable, perhaps because it was a good rule-of thumb that the best fruit was less accessible, as the more accessible good fruit had already been eaten. After the industrial revolution, this did not become true, but since our brains did not evolve that much, you can make people believe that if effort is put in, the results are of higher quality.

Effortlessness: [#Dwec41] Society admires effortlessness accomplishment and thereby fosters a belief in it. {EW: probably because we try to measure people's REAL abilities/genetic fitness, which is obscured by practice}

Ego: [#Tonn15] Stars need a big ego {EW: though as Tonnekreek uses it, it may be a mixture of intense longing for attention combined with high self-confidence/guts to dare make a solo show}. Should be combined with “bord voor je kop” to protect the ego in case of disappointments. If you don't believe you're worth buying tickets for, who will? [#Tonn76] Note that ego and addiction to 'highs' can also break your career if you're very dependent on employers, if you're a model for example. Late-coming, drug-addicted, undisciplined (secretly eating poffertjes) prima-donna models are the (too often real) nightmare of model agencies.

Ego-orientation: [#Pers338] The motivation to establish superiority over others. Contrasts with task-orientation. [#Franzen190] + Whether one will impress others.

Ego-strength: [#Eyse123] Usually ego-strength correlates negatively to psychopathology (and neuroticism). However, those individuals who happen to have both some psychopathology and ego-strength do exist (though relatively rarely), and those are very creative.

Egocentric thinking: [#NS271110] Thinking about our own views and about other people's views mostly overlap in brain activity, but there is an almost perfect match between thinking about your own view and thinking about God's view. Most likely explanation is that the less evidence we have about other people's believes, the more we equate them with our own beliefs. [Also leading to atrocious gift-giving]

Egosynthonic: [#Wiki] feelings, values and behaviours that are in harmony with the needs and goals of the ego, or consistent with one's own self-image.

Ehrenfest, Paul: [#Wiki] Physicist, was also depressed and killed himself.

Eigen, Manfred: [#Haggit109] Wanted to be a musician, could not play in war years, turned to studying. Superior officer upset when Eigen was learning English [so quite daring]

Einstein, Albert: [#John42] Compensated for his weaknesses in mathematics by his friendship with mathematician Marcel Grossman.[#Robi59] Talked to poets on imagination, studied all forms of expression to expand his mind. {EW: check!} Improvised melodies on his violin while thinking about complex problems. {EW: while thinking or subconsciously mulching?} [#Crop202] Was fortunate enough that Riemann had developed a proper non-Euclidian geometry already for his theory of relativity in the 1850s. Considered life in the patent office a 'kind of salvation', interesting, but not demanding, without the pressures of an academic job he was free to explore the essentials. Father Hermann was cheerful optimist but prone to business failures {perhaps because of being overoptimistic} Wrote to be guided by 'Strenuous labour and the contemplation of God's nature' through the tumult of life {so some neuroticism? Dislike of chaos?}. Spent too much of his intellectual and emotional strength on his work to make a difficult marriage succeed, though may also have had some inner resistance, as he saw marriage as his duty. Was not always a very enthousiastic teacher; was quite good at explaining his ideas, but lecture preparation was seldom a subject of interest to him. And frankly, he jumped at the chance of not having to teach in Berlin. Avoided all formality and ceremony, hated discipline and militarism. But admired Planck- formal employee of Prussian state- for his integrity and dedication to physics. Youngest son developed schizophrenia (but mother was mentally less stable as well, so may not have been Albert's genes). Einstein later married his cousin, who was a very efficient manager of his non-scientific affairs and proud to be married to such a great man. Hear from friend Grossman about Riemann's geometry. Was less creative after the 1920s, perhaps because he loved performing and politics (and had some extramarital affairs as well!) Also focused too much on finding an unified field theory, in which he failed; his tenacity turned against him. Had the religion of being awed by nature, but not classical moralism. Irresistable longing to understand the secrets of nature. Was able to drop a failing theory quickly and without regrets and get on with the next one. Friends with many people, including Paul Langevin, who told him about De Broglie's work. [#Isaac78] Could generally do his work in the patent office in 2 to 3 hours, his boss graciously allowing him to work on physics in the rest of the time. [#Isaac1] Addressed his friend as a 'frozen whale' in a letter. Mileva Maric, his first wife, was also a sounding board and helped him check his math. AE was definitely not a conformist, and seemed happy with that. Compassionate towards mankind, but often aloof and detached from those around him [bit of a hagiography, me not like] Antiauthoritarian. Neither liked rote learning and did not excel in mental powers; visualisation and imagination were strengths, however. [#Isaac9] One schoolmaster announced that Einstein would never amount to much. Had mild form of echolalia [repeating sentences to himself if they pleased him], and did lots of thinking in pictures. Family line valued education. Father showed 'inclination for mathematics' but family could not afford university. Moved though to mathematics-city Ulm. Friendly, mild and wise man; almost docile, and bad in business matters. Einstein's mother was strong, though, practical though with a combination of dourness and humor. Uncle Jakob had graduated as an engineer, and had a gas and electrical supply business. Albert generally shied from the boisterous games of his cousins, being a loner; more inclined to daydreaming and meditative musing. Liked puzzles and to erect complex structures, and build houses of cards [so must have been quite patient/persevering]. Had a fierce temper though as a child, even throwing objects at his sister. Mother was accomplished pianist and arranged violin lessons for him. Father referred to Jewish rituals as 'ancient superstitions'. Outsider at school; teachers were liberal-minded, but fellow-students were antisemitics. Developed a passionate zeal for Judaism at the gymnasium, strictly keeping the laws. Even composed his own hymns for the glorification of God. Didn't like Latin and Greek, but even there often got top grades. Uncle Jakob introduced him to the joys of algebra, and gave him ever more difficult challenges, good-naturedly doubting the boy's ability to solve them. Parents brought him textbooks in advance. Liked to find things out by reasoning alone {so not dependent on 'outside' knowledge, either because it is hard work or because it was unreliable?} Einstein never read light literature, nor was ever in the company of other schoolboys his age. Talmud brought him science books, such as the 'People's books on Natural science' by Aaron Bernstein, which Einstein read breathlessly. Bernstein was also fascinated by the speed of light. Bernstein also very visual 'being on a speeding train', and was enthousiastic about science. Talmud also brought Einstein Euclid, which was perhaps even more fascinating, and after a few months Einstein surpassed Talmud in maths. Popular scientific books however also led Einstein to backlash against faith, as he concluded that many of the stories of the Bible could not be true {so he connected ideas}. But he also extended this to a general distrust of 'received knowledge' and authority.Didn't like the regiment at school. Helped in 1895 with the family company, then moved to Italy. Copiously noted his ideas in the margins of text books. Also liked the solitude of hiking in the mountains. [#Greene276] ?Decided to become an experimental scientist after he had been devising an experiment for detecting ether and it had been rejected by a professor, because he was 'not good at it'? Had a little notebook and filled it up with all kinds of ideas. Got idea for general relativity after deciding to give it up and talking it over with a colleague from the patent office. [so talking-mode]

Elaborate representation: [#Medina] The more we talk or write or think about something, the better we'll remember it. More emotion also helps (how much do you like/dislike something, or the meaning of something). {EW: perhaps a better hit chance on the memory if it is connected to more neurons?} [#Clar167] The more ways and the more times, the better it is! [#Nati139] Ranking different options can be a good way to use elaborative rehearsal in learning words; at least better than saying which option you prefer.

Elderly: [#Robi201] The elderly in the Grace Living Center, a home for the elderly In Oklahoma, use less medication since they can be reading buddies for the children. The children learn to read better, too. Also known as the Book Buddies project.

Electronic communication: [#Imagine207] In an experiment, groups had a much easier time solving a difficult problem when restricted to e-mail and instant messenging, than when they interacted face-to-face.

Elephant-rider model: [#HeaB6] If Spock wants to get up at 5:45, he'll do it; no drama required. But people apparently have strong emotions as well, counteracting our intentions. You however generally need the energy and drive of the elephant to reach a big goal {talent?} [#HaidtH16] The rider is better seen as an advisor than as a king; the autonomous system is more evolved and has its finger on the dopamine button.

Elevation: [#HaidtH194] Seventh emotion, though not strongly associated with a  facial expression like the 6 basic emotions which include its opposite, disgust. Warm or pleasant feelings in the chest, no physiological arousal. Vagus nerve might be activated. Different from happiness or admiration, which energizes and gives chills or tingles on the skin. People who are elevated may want to help others, but become passive due to the relaxation Church may give collective elevation, the agape.

Ellis, Albert: [#Burkem44] Was notorious for swearing. Was also generally difficult person [arguments with other directors of institute].

Elshout: [#Busa13] Psychologist who studied 'expert beginners'

EM: [#Strien106] Evaluation matrix, Theo Kuipers.

Embarrasment: [#Zill127] Embarrasment seems to increase systolic blood pressure, but also block intake of information by the brain.

Emergenesis: [#Simo?] Productivity by scientists is not bell-shaped, but rather J-shaped, perhaps through the product of several independent factors which must all be 'right'?

Eminence: [#Simo4] Eminence of people/geniuses is not just in this culture and this time, it tends to transcend culture and time (if you're very famous now in the Netherlands, you will be famous too in other countries, and still in 200 years). Eminence correlates very well with the number of influential products/memes an individual has left to the world (Mozart has over 30 times as much pieces in the classical music repertoire than Tartini). (or: total lifetime productivity)

Eminent scientists: [#Strien277] Often first-born child of a middle-class family, son of professional man. Very high IQ, began to do great deal of reading in boyhood. Tended to feel lonely and different and to be shy and aloof from his classmates. Only moderate interest in girls. Only decided to be a scientist in the junior or senior year of college, almost invariably this was due to an independent research project where he could find out things for himself. He works hard and devoted in his laboratory, often 7 days a week. Few recreations, except for some individualistic activities (fishing, sailing, walking). Movies bore him; avoids social affairs and political acticity. Social scientists tended to be more social (less introverted), more divorces, in youth more conflicts at home (dominant mother, a bit colourless father). Generally high intrinsic motivation. “Iron self-discipline and working hard, dedication, workaholic, huge and langdurige concentration, strong achievement motivation, more aimed at business than at persons, belief in the value of one's activities, need for autonomy, asking high quality of own work and that of co-workers, avoiding emotional situations, impatience and being annoyed at laggards and 'dwarsliggers', a wide knowledge in their own field, usually also wide interest outside their field (cross fertilization), able to work on different things at the same time; being willing to take intellectual risks, being tolerant for ambiguity, being able to relinquish intellectual control without becoming afraid, non-conformist, flexible in thinking, seeking alternatives, willingness to criticize and improve their own creative solutions. Concert and museum-visits are low, but active art-activity does tend to be at a high level, and are quite knowledgeable in passive knowledge about art. Usually had quite a strong desire to be left alone (by wife, kids...) Though Darwin, for example, also needed rest and hated uninvited guests, but could converse pleasantly with invitees.

Emotion contagion: [#Nass130] Spread of emotions, since people tend to mimic each other's language, facial expressions, postures, and movements. Happy friends (and friends of friends) make you more happy as well!

Emotional autonomy: [#Csik33] The ability to tolerate the solitude necessary for cultivating one's talent.

Emotional blocks: [#Adams39] Accepting an idea may contribute to anxiety, since identifying with an idea can lead to being hurt by its rejection. Man can create for reasons of inner drive. Fear of making mistake, to fail, to risk; inability to tolerate ambiguity; preference for judging ideas rather than gererating them; inability to relax, incubate; lack of challenge versus excessive zeal; inability to distinguish reality from fantasy. Note that fears of conceptualization are not based on realistic assumptions of the consequences (8 years work, possibly failure of marriages). Building block can be alleviated by realistically assessing the possible negative consequences of an idea. Most people either blithely ignore all consequences, or their general fear of failure causes them to attach excessive importance to any 'mistake'. Doing a brief study of possible consequences of a 'risky' idea can work. (two page 'catastrophic expectations' report, if everything went wrong, swapping analytical capability for fear of failure, which is a good trade). Second point: you must usually wallow in ill-fitting or misleading data. Also, you need to be able to access all senses [Medina's multimodality]

Emotional intelligence: [#NS190110] There are at least two types of emotional intelligence, the capability to judge emotions in other people (experiential emotional intelligence) and strategic emotional intelligence (choosing the socially appropriate actons). The two types are housed in different brain regions, and neither at the seat of cognitive intelligence!

Emotional inversion: [#Greene195] The ability to be aware that our emotions colour our perspective and flip them for better insights: setbacks are valuable since they teach us useful things, victories are dangerous because they make us complacent and overconfident in our ability, making us underestimate luck.

Emotional involvement: [#Zill126] Emotional involvement is strengthened by how exciting something is, and how unpleasant something is (and unpleasantness also enhances critical thinking)

Emotional stimulation: [#Myst25] As long as you correctly work in on a person's feelings (opposite of convincing) they'll tend to go along with you since it feels right, rationalization performed then will support her feelings.

Emotionality: [#Hatt8] Expert teachers, like experts in other fields, show more emotionality about success and failures in their work.

Emotions: [#Root03] Citing Dimasio, without emotion people cannot reason well (at least, they cannot choose). {EW: would emotion therefore be necessary to (sub?)consciously choose the best option out of those many the brain generates? Would aesthetics and emotions be linked? Would therefore most scientists feel enthousiastic when they find an answer?} [#Medi80] Emotional things tend to get attention easier than neutral things, as the released dopamine strengthens memory. The emotional components of an experience are remembered better than anything else. [#Gall19] Do emotions set into motion a 'thinking' process, which may in sports both lead to a tunnel vision as to more tension and interfering with the procedural knowledge of the player? {EW: and outside sports, would it be productive in a purely declarative situation?} [#EricB395] Emotional states must be managed/self-regulated by writers, who must often work long hours alone. Done by losing themselves in their work, engineering their environment, adhering to a work schedule and practicing motivational rituals. [#EW] Emotions may indicate not specific levels of happiness or unhappiness, but the change to a better or worse state (which is, of course, more relevant to learning the right actions). [#Kluw175] Emotions help encoding; people with damaged amygdala's don't profit from the better encoding that normal people have from emotionally arousing memories.[#Pers77] If your job requires you to fake emotions, it may cause you to lose touch with your own feelings, and deteriorate your relationship with your colleagues. But the true key may be whether you act superficially or deep: whether you just pretend to be nice or consciously produce thoughts that encourage you to be in a more pleasant emotional state [role model? Different world view or view of other?]. Actually, for “deep actors”, jobs with high levels of emotional labour are more rewarding! [#NS08102011, 'Twitter mood reveals world emotions'] people tend to wake up in a good mood, which deteriorates as the day wears on. [#Franzen166] High arousal may not also mean high affect, take astonishment for example. [#Davidsonxi] Emotional state is a fleeting moment; if an emotion persists for days, it's called a 'mood' [EW: need to be reconfirmed by other experiences, possibly filtered, or thoughts?]. If it persists for years, it's called a trait. [#Davidson119] Social isolation is less healthy, but may not be unhealthy for introverts or people who are stressed by social interaction. Positive emotions may be healthy to some degree for beginning illnesses with good treatments, excessively positive emotions can however lead to problems like seeking treatment too late. [#Davidson122] Even if, according to objective measurements, cold are equally severe in happy and grumpy volunteers, happy volunteers report milder symptoms. Nuns expressing more positive emotions in their writing lived longer; though negative emotions showed no correlation (EW: since most nuns don't have a very dangerous lifestyle?). Better, closer personal ties make people have lower risk for disease and premature death. Left-side activation of the brain results in a stronger immune response than 'right-brainers'. [#135] Fight-or-flight-response seems to result from amygdala, insula, and part of the right prefrontal cortex. [#SellHuman105] Displaying positive emotion during tough negotiations makes it more likely that others will accept your terms. Positive emotions may also enhance our behavioural repertoire and make us more receptive and creative. [#NRC020900] Suppressing negative emotions about an event diminishes memories of the event; reframing the emotion 'he doesn't mean badly' does not affect memory. Possibly because self-control (not showing emotions) drains willpower. [#Nass130] Physiological state of emotions tends to linger a while. [#Nelissen32] An emotion is like a conductor of an orchestra, determining which behaviours must be prioritized or coordinated (working together) to achieve the momentarily most important goal. [EW: the emotions/feelings may also help decide the priority or action?]. Behaviour may also be the sharpening of the senses. Or reinterpreting aspects of the environment (from obstacle to shelter), or making the brain access relevant details (hearing about a murderer), or activating the learning systems. Note that most emotions are never perfect (just make average chance of success go up), they are also not always that well-adapted to modern situations – a man following you on 50 meters in a busy shopping street is more natural and much less threatening than a man following you on 50 meters through the savannah. Similarly, people are not afraid of cigarettes, even while they are afraid of snakes and spiders. [#62] Emotions, like 'feeling indebted' may also have evolved to make living in a society more possible – they make people more likely to pay off debts than pure ratio might impel them to. And 'rationally reasoned revenge' is not as scary as emotionally reasoned one (hence the effectiveness of the crazy cabdriver-ploy). Some emotions are complex: you can be sad on your own, but jealousy always requires another/society. Joy/vreugde increases happiness, happiness increases the joy you get from things.[#81] Emotions can be mixed; tears of joy being tears because the person is also reminded of the sacrifices they had to make to get there. [#107] Time is the enemy of emotions. Some, like anger, we can diminish by either 'opsplitsing' (the car is driven in my preferred parking spot, split behaviour from person) or empathy (would I have done the same if I were him/her?) [#NS270216FacingUpToAParadox]CEOs who wear fearful expressions saw a 0.4 rise in stock prices within the following week, while those who showed disgust saw a 9.3 pre cent increase in the following quarter [#Seligm52] In psychology, not just try to decrease negative emotions, another route is to learn how to deal with them. [#Seligm139] Are our emotions/reactions proportional to the danger/problem? [#Lyubom274] Positive emotions (joy, contentment) allow you to recover faster from negative emotions. [#NS190817Gamers’VitalSignsHelpTheirFansStayHooked] When viewers can see (via emoji) what emotions a gamer is feeling, they feel more connected and watch more. [#https://feelinggood.com/science-behind-t-e-a-m-therapy/] External people (including psychiatrists) are extremely bad at assessing other people’s emotional state; one should always measure [Burns suggesting patient questionnaires, what about external observer?]. Also note that people don’t feel their feelings very fine-grained, especially when feelings are extreme: everything is great – or rotten.  [#NS260817The man who reads dog minds and personalities in a brain scanner] Reinforce good internal states with praise and play, decrease bad states through calming approaches (?)

Empathizing: [#Root03] Eight of 13 thinking tools, empathizing means imagining you are in another's skin, whether that other is a person, a stone, a molecule, a gene or an animal.

Empathy: [#Franzen61/EW] Empathy may have evolved to help us understand (and manipulate?) others better. [#Franzen271] Empathy is not a motivation, but a tendency, that can be effectively blocked by focusing on your own goals or constraints such as time pressure. [White86] Knowing what would be the 'personal bonus' for X if he/she hired you is extremely useful. [#NS220912] Jews and Palestinians activate normal empathic brain regions when their enemies are suffering, but that's not all of empathy: the interpretation also matters. Empathy gap can be diminished by being told the enemy's life story, but if there is an asymmetry of power the underlings mainly want a chance to to get their perspectives heard (so they may not so much need to hear the dominant person's story). We are also more likely to harbour negative attitudes towards others when we believe them incapable of change. That belief itself, however, can be changed. Peace more often achievable if opponents recognize sacred values and make symbolic gestures to atone for past wrongs. Offering money and such to compromise on sacred values gives outrage, however. [#NRC290911] People scoring high on empathy also have a strong reaction when a message does not fit the speaker (such as a 6-year old telling about drinking a glass of beer every evening. [#NRC131110Hrdy] American students of the last 30 years show less empathy than before. [#NS260915] Weaknesses of empathy: is very narrow (one person versus millions) and focused on here and now instead of on the future. Made worse by us looking at most newsworthy instead of important issues. Citalopram, a SSRI, makes people more sensitive to the possibility of inflicting harm on others – give more money to prevent a stranger from getting an electric shock. [#NS140516IFeelYourPain] Stress is contagious (even stress of a stranger, over a video screen ), interestingly psychopaths can switch empathy on; and compassion meditation/loving kindness meditation can also decrease empathy (at least while it is being performed – decreasing activity in anterior insula and amygdala). Seeing another in physical pain lits up the emotional regions, especially the anterior insula, even while it leaves the physical pain centres unaffected. [#https://feelinggood.com/science-behind-t-e-a-m-therapy/] If a therapist is more warm and understanding, a depressed patient tends to recover more quickly. Still, the effect is only 30% at most, so more tools than empathy need to be used.

Empathy maps: [#Hooked54]

Employability: [#Int161211] Klaas Knot always asked himself: 'what do I have in terms of experience, and how can I enrich that?'; always worked more on employability than employment.

Employee: [#Patter138] Ask employees (and bosses) whose opinions, work and abilities they most admired. Those were the people who knew their stuff, focused on the right stuff (by learning (and trying to understand) where the organization is going, and had built a reputation for being helpful.Can ask or prod one’s boss or would-be-managers those three questions (know, do right stuff, be helpful)

Employees: [#Whoxiv] Having great employees is more important than having great strategy. Most important success factor for manager is finding the right employees [EW: really? And networking?] Problems are when managers are unclear about what the job requires, have a weak flow of candidates, can't pick the right candidate from a group, or lose people they've offered the job. One problem is that finding the right people and checking their claims properly takes time, and time is precious. You want A players, people who have at least 90% chance to achieve what top 10%-candidates can achieve. Use scorecard (list of outcomes and competences, usually 3 to 8 outcomes sorted in order of importance. Also helps employees decide what to focus their efforts on). Also need a CEO who is confident enough to have A players around him or her. Also hire deep specialists; generalists are generally not that useful.Look for narrow but deep competence, especially if you have defined your position correctly from the outset. A players have efficiency, integrity, organisation, aggressiveness, follow-through on commitments, intelligence (learns quickly), analytical skills, attention to detail, persistence, proactivity. Know yourself (adjectives to describe our culture?) And always identify the who before a new hire is needed. Source candidates by asking for referrals from your personal and professional networks. “Who are the most talented people you know that I should hire?” Generally ask the top-10 talented people you know for that, talented people know talented people. Call a few new people from your list every week. Also ask your own employees! “If you spot someone like us, at a customer, supplier, or competitor, we want to hire them!” 30 minutes a week, sort A players on priority, start making calls until you have at least one conversation “X recommended that you and I connect. I understand that you are great at what you do. I am always on the lookout for talented people and would love the chance to get to know you. Even if you are perfectly content in your current job, I'd love to introduce myself and hear about your career interests.” After a little chat, ask for most talented people who might be a good fit for my company. Interviews: screening interview, topgrading interview, focused interview, reference interview. Screening interview: phone, 30 minutes: what are your career goals, what are you really good at professionally (8-12, + ask for examples)? What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally? [if necessary, ask what their previous bosses would say] – need 5-8 real weaknesses who where your last 5 bosses, and how will they rate your performance on a 1-10 scale when we talk to them (7 is neutral, 6 is bad). [Talented people know what they want to do and are not afraid to tell you about it] Extend or shorten the time if the candidate seems good or bad. And in advance say that after 20 minutes, you'll be willing to answer any questions the candidate has on you. If you're not excited about the possibility to bring them in, screen them out. For properties: what do you mean, how so, tell me more to get concrete pictures. Topgrading: for each job: what were you hired to do? What accomplishments are you most proud of? What were some low points during the job? Who were the people you worked with? Why did you leave that job? [start by highs and lows of educational experience] Low points: what would you have done differently, in what ways were your peers stronger than you? .. What would Mr Smith say were your biggest strengths and areas of improvement? (if necessary: what would your boss say behind your back). Suspend your judgment during the interview and get curious: you'll never know what you hear. And move chronologically through the person's career, that works better. Tips: interrupt the candidate to get on to more important stuff, by smiling to match their enthusiasm level, then summarize their statement, and ask your next question. Ask for performance compared to 3Ps: previous year's performance, Plan and Peers. Push vs Pull: don't hire people who were pushed out of their previous jobs 3x as much as they were pulled. Always try to put yourself in other's shoes. What happened at the last job? Why did that not work out? Put themselves in their shoes to understand how and why they are making decisions and handling problems. Conduct Topgrading interview in tandem with a colleague. Then Focused interview (can also get other colleagues to help). “Purpose of interview is to talk about <sth from scorecard>, biggest accomplishments, biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area?” Let every interviewer do one or two outcomes and competencies. Also check for cultural fit. And finally, don't skip the references! Pick references from topgrading interview, ask candidate to set up the calls. 7 in total, 3 past bosses, 2 peers or customers, 2 subordinates. In what context did you work with that person? What are that person's biggest strengths? Biggest areas for improvement back then? Overall performance in 1-10 rating, what about his or her performance causes you to give that rating? The person mentioned that he/she struggled with X in that job. Can you tell me more about that? ('back then': in reality, people don't change that much, but frees others from feeling to criticize). “the person mentioned that you might say he was disorganized”. For CEOs, don't talk to their bosses, but to their subordinates, 2 or 3 levels down to learn how that person interacts. References: read between the lines, watch for enthusiasm instead of ehnms... and er..s, watch for “if...then”s, that is code (if you want someone who is willing to disagree with you, then hire this guy). Or lukewarm/qualified praise. Red flags: candidate -does not mention past failires/exaggerates his or her answers/takes credit for the work of others/speaks poorly of past bosses/cannot explain job moves, most important people around him/her are unsupportive of change, (for managerial hires) candidate never had to hire or fire anyone/ candidate seems more interested in compensation and benefits than in job itself/candidate tries too hard to look like an expert/candidate is self-absorbed, winning too much (2 hour search for 10$ cheaper toy) Adding too much value (adding ideas to yours) or starting a sentence with no, but or however (overactive ego) Telling the world how smart they are, passing the buck, making destructive comments about previous colleagues, making excuses, 'that's just me, I'm not...”. For hiring, put yourself in the candidates shoes, fit (company's vision, needs and culture with candidate's goals, strengths and values), family, freedom (autonomy), fortune, fun (personal relationships). People want to make an impact on the world and feel needed. Don't focus on selling the candidate, but the spouse, children, parents and friends of the candidate. Role of CEO is to inspire people, and you can't do that unless you get to know them and they you. And don't overpay (colleagues get jealous) or underpay (will be whisked away by competitors). More managers undersell (don't try hard enough to sell their company to the candidate) than oversell. Persistence pays off! First 100 days alarming failure rate, so keep an eye on them and help them (insights from interviews should help).[#http://www.intermediair.nl/magazine/20141204/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2014wk49&utm_campaign=iw&e=1&m_i=WytWuUAgzreS9x2fCngH0aIIlMbgxbSTxffCudgklhchf5Ta5NAuLa4hbir%2BkBaxeZ%2BKjY_eZj0kolbUtzDUrpxd4iei_#10] Employees who work longer at the same company help make the company more innovative, as long as they don't stay on the same spot too long (internal rotation). Tom Mom thinks that this is because people accumulate multiple different skills and can integrate multiple different viewpoints. Though more autonomy and 'natural leadership' may also help the person who stays long.

Emulate: [#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsuCFL-SQLg] James Altucher always tries to emulate people and things which are better than himself (like Google)

Encoding: [#Wolt42] Encoding in memory increases when the encoding can be distinguished better from other encodings, the organisation of the encodings (for example, learning a number of countries next to each other instead of dispersed throughout a list) and how the encoding is associated with existing knowledge. People who are tired or depressed encode less elaborately. {so worse memories?}[#Medi105] Encoding really works like a disassembler, throwing each piece of the input into a separate container. Note that some encodings enable better retrieval of desired information better than others do (analogy works better than letter count for remembering words)

Encouragement: [#Ster435] Without early encouragement by their parents, most successful young musicians would have diminished or stopped practicing at an early age. {EW: so musical practice for most kids is in itself not very pleasant}

Encyclopedia: [#Watt163] Storing your notes or observations in a certain system (per category) is useful.

End in mind: [#http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html ]Steve Jobs: if today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. [#EW: like parental loss, don't hope for a better future, make it now]

Endorphins: [#Nelissen202] Often produced after physical exercise, though quite large individual differences. Lack of endorphins makes women seek social contacts.

Endowed progress effect: [#Hooked89] If we have 2 out of 10 stamps, we are more motivated to complete than if we have zero out of eight.

Endowment effect: [#NS290314,MyPrecious] Endowment effect: the inclination to value things above what others think they're worth. Also applies to just imagining having something – that also makes us value it more. It also helps that we often have 'transformation expectations' – we expect things to make our lives better, and enhance the way we are viewed by others.

Enemies: [#Hargit69] Enemies can be useful: if you have written up your results, your friends may not have time to look at them, but your enemies will try to prove you wrong, which may bring about your best performance. [#Stalla143] (On helping Germany recover from WWII) “Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, desperation, and chaos.”

Energy: [#Root] Top scientists are unusually energetic, both physically and mentally. {and Darwin?} [#Ster42] Also a characteristic of very creative persons. [#Peal29] Energy is mainly lost through emotional upheaval, not by hard work. Can be slowly clogged by accumulation of little guilts and worries and frustrations and fears. Or eliminated by boredom. [#Loeh4] Every one of our thoughts, emotions and behaviours has an energy consequence. We must be physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused and spiritually aligned with a purpose beyond our immediate self-interest. [#EW/Oswald250713] People can get energy from different sources: social contacts, learning new things, being creative, sports, whatever – different sources yielding different amounts of energy, some perhaps tending to 'overstimulate easily' (like sports for creative people). [#Seligm69] Can dance, exercise, meditation or a brief walk restore one's energy?

Engagement: [#Loeh5]The longer employees spend with organizations, the less engaged they become. {EW: if a reward is not new anymore, it may automatically devalue} [#Hatt185] Engagement decreases when classes go higher, are lower for English and social studies than for maths, are lowest when listening to a teacher lecturing or when asked to watch television, and highest when working in groups or laboratories. The more students are challenged, the more they are engaged. [#http://www.arnoldbakker.com/workengagement.php] Engagement has three components: vigor (stimulating), dedication (work feels meaningful, significant) and absorption (engrossing, mind is taken up in it) Engagement, in contrast to 'motivation' is correlated to job performance and financial returns [#Tiggelaar] Also because of feeling of progress? {EW: mastery?} [#DeMoor18] Employees like to be consulted and participate in decisions that will affect them. They want to be treated as belonging to and being an integral part of a group. [#HRMInt] HiPo's are relatively often unengaged, as they work harder than others, but don't get rewards like challenging work or interesting career paths. Also, many HiPos (70%) are not suitable for higher positions, they need not only ability and engagement, but also aspiration (longing for recognition and having the same goals as the organisation). Another problem: not allowing chance of failure prevents them from being stressed and stretched. A last problem: not keeping HiPos informed about strategy – they feel disengaged if the organisation is doing stuff and not telling anyone what or why they're doing it. [#Int261012, ArnoldBakker] Engaged employees are very energetic, dedicated and find it easy to keep working hard since they experience flow, enjoy their tasks, and are intrinsically motivated. 12% of employees is engaged, 70% content, 5% burned out, 13% near burn-out. Engaged people also tend to feel when they have to stop, 'work-addicts' just keep working and slump in front of the TV to 'recuperate' (which doesn't work). Engaged people are also active in their free time, do sports or visit theatre. Engaged people do 'job crafting', 'blijven sleutelen aan hun baan', searching for interesting tasks and asking for help if something does not work. Have supervisors who produce a climate of trust, of sufficient autonomy, and of support if the work is difficult. Engagement is related to extraversion (make contacts more easily, asking for help when needed), C and low N also help. Only a quarter is as engaged after 5 years. [#EW] Would engagement “flow” be related to mastery (this is a good environment as I can control it and to reward (lack of boredom – I need not find greener pastures) [#Stalla3] Higher engagement leads to 20% higher productivity, and makes people 87% less likely to quit.[#16] Vision, value and voice needed for engagement (people need to feel part of something greater, they need to feel valued as human beings (feel cared for by boss and colleagues), they need to feel heard (and be told things; and bosses need to seek advice too of their employees! Communication needs to be respectful, however)

Engblom, Skip: [#Coyl138] Mentor of Z-boys, says he's free to talk to schools or anyone on coaching, as he has lots of thoughts on that.

Engineering: [#Flourish60] Psychology may not have been a 'real science' since it had no engineering, no principles that turned out to work in the real world [EW?]

Engram: [#Kluw74] A small set of neurons who, when stimulated, will stimulate more neurons for the 'entire' memory. The engram can be formed relatively quickly (and is formed in the hippocampus), in contrast to much smaller changes in the neocortex. The engram is a kind of access code.

Engraving: [#CoyleT7] Spend 15 minutes a day watching something of top performers (a video, an audio recording) to engrave the correct result in your brain.

Enjoyment: [#EW/#Robi21] Are there people who are successful but do NOT enjoy their work? {EW: or should you distinguish between successful people and very successful people?} {short-term and/or subtop? McEnroe?}[#Csik8] Enjoying the work is one of the main characteristics of successful scientists, perhaps the most important one. However, that does NOT mean that their work is always pleasant or easy – they enjoy the challenges, the mastering too. [#RoadToExcel26] Deliberate practice with strong social interaction can be enjoyable, even if not as enjoyable as active leisure or sleep.

Enlightenment: [#Newportxvi] Enlightenment does not automatically remove your worries and anxieties.

Enriched environment: [#Kluw34] Animals growing up/living in an enriched environment develop thicker and heavier cortices, a more extensive branching of dendrites, and a larger number of dendritic spines. Results in faster learning, especially in more complex tasks.

Enteric Nervous System (ENS): [#NS151212] 500 million neurons, 5x rat brain, may have been original nervous system. Also influences mood: stimulating vagus nerve can decrease depression. May also be a kind of 'sixth sense', responding to opportunities and threats in food, and influencing the actions of the 'bigger brain'.

Entertainment: [Zillviii] People like to be entertained – and get gratified by that. [EW: is knowledge also entertainment? Entertainment similar to McDonalds or porn movies? People want success – so they get entertainment...]

Enthusiasm: [#AlejSTP/EW] Would great enthusiasm make one overestimate oneself and underestimate the obstacles? [#MirjamRamrattan] In groups, adolescents are notoriously unenthusiastic, but when one on one, they can feel excited. [#http://www.intermediair.nl/artikel/competenties-en-vaardigheden/290372/zo-houd-je-lol-in-je-werk-zonder-van-baan-te-veranderen.html?&utm_campaign=redactiemailing&utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Week482011] Enthusiastic employees have to work hard to stay thay way, asking feedback and support, continuing to improve themselves.

Entrepreneurs: [#Gawan171] It's easier to find a good idea than it is to find a good entrepreneur, someone willing and able to work long hours and tolerate setbacks, for years on end, bring idea into reality, can handle both people problems and technical problems. {EW: may be as rare as excellent scientists} Best entrepreneurs are not found on instinct, but with checklists, the 'airline pilot' approach. [#Int090911] The IEA (Individual Entrepreneurial Aptitude) scores on 8 scales: risk taking, competitiveness, pro-activity, responsibility, optimism, self-assurance, innovativeness and efficiency. Women score lower than men on each point, especially on risk-taking and competitiveness. [#SellHuman30] Successful entrepreneurs often experiment first. May also be a rise of entrepreneurs since web makes it easier to have a weird speciality yet still reach customers. [#ArjanVanDenBorn] People who want to succeed as an entrepreneur have to do their work well, know the right people, but market circumstances are still deciding. {Well, they sent questionnaires. Pff... anyway} Market circumstances 33.6%, skills & knowledge 25.6%, network 20.7%, motivation 5.8%, personality 1.1%. Biggest problem is that people don't study their market. Earn on average as much as an employee, but depends on the sector; journalists are poor, ICTers earn quite decently. [#Int030513] ZZPers, even if they earn enough, miss colleagues, for social contacts or as sounding boards. Sometimes they want more challenge (paid work is not always challenging). Though also practical: mortgage, and employers give more vacation, fixed working times, you don't have to save / arrange pensions, etc. [#https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140915225357-6126609-starting-a-business-beg-borrow-and-take-all-the-free-stuff-you-can-get?trk=eml-mktg-inf-m-doit-0916-p7]] Less than 1% of all startups get funded, and ¾ths of them still fail. [#EW] Entrepreneurs are usually not the best specialists – learning about what needs to be done can interfere with being a specialist in how things are best done. [#Gilbert] For his first company, Gilbert listened too much to people who may have had lots of experience in setting up companies, but had much less knowledge of his field than he had. Second important rule was collaborate with Els: find someone you like but who is not like you are, who complements you. [#MiltonChang] Use your (own) expertise to identify a need, then you're not taking a huge risk, a smaller market can also mean less capital needed, and you have time to hone your business and management skills before being overwhelmed with growth. Take classes, attend seminars, read as many business articles and books as you can find long before you start

Entropy: [#Erdogmus,2002] Entropy, especially Renyi's entropy, may be a more accurate ground for learning than Bayesian statistics {EW: like the Bayesian brain?}

Enumerations: [#http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm] Can be memorized with peg system {EWL/Buzan} or splitting it up in subsets list grouped on chronology or such.

Environment: [#https://hbr.org/2017/02/want-to-be-more-productive-sit-next-to-someone-who-is?referral=00203&utm_source=newsletter_management_tip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tip_date] It is good if productive employees (low quality, high productivity) sit next to quality employees (low productivity, high quality). Generalist employees can be coupled, and toxic employees (fired for dismeanors) should be isolated from the rest since they increase the chance neighboring employees turn toxic too. Note that if a worker is already high on quality or productivity, less sensitive to spillover (lowering quality/productivity if seated next to a lower-performing person) [#Weiner237] Genius is also through a person-environment fit, Beethoven moved to Vienna because he knew he would prosper there (find good colleagues and audience...)

Environmental blocks: [#Adams53] Lack of cooperation and trust among colleagues, autocratic boss, distractions (phone, easy intrusions), lack of support to bring ideas into action (whether it is money or time or expertise or encouragement). Or simply hot room/cold room, music or no music. Schiller filled his desk with rotten apples. Imagine your ideal environment for creativity, and try to get more of it in your working environment. Ideas can be squelched by laughing at them, over-analyzing them, or ignoring them. Note that some of the best idea-havers are relatively self-confident and less dependent of support by others. One colleague of Adams threw together a horribly poor idea and then incorporated criticism of others, and iterate again and again. Competition and lack of trust destroy such a supportive environment [if ideas get stolen or others are jealous, not good for openness]

Environmental structuring: [#EricB711] Making the environment conductive to studying and relatively distraction-free. See also the reference to Fox. [#Switch208] Moving can help: 36% of successul changes involved moving to a new environment, yet only 13% of unsuccessful changes did.

Environmental vicious cycle: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-campus/201109/how-fraternities-and-sororities-impact-students-or-do-they] Students who tend to drink flock to fraternities, where they are encouraged by social support to drink even more!

Envy: [#Greene142] Avoid envy by displaying errors in another area, or show great interest in the work of the insecure person. Intelligence is most sensitive trigger point for envy, so don't stand out too much and maintain a non-threatening exterior until you are so successful it no longer matters. [#Paul194] People can deal with envy in two ways “I can do it better” or “that other thing is vile/wrong”

Epigenetics: [#EW] Epigenetic 'mutations' are much more common than mutations during cell divisions; could they also affect intelligence/creativity/talent? Or be the hidden factor in personality (next to genes and environment and infections?) [#NS080111] May be an extra randomization of nature to help offspring survive; you never know what you're gonna get (qua environment), epigenetic mutations may help that.

Epiphanies: [#HaidtH26] Epiphanies can be life-altering, but most fade in days or weeks, as they work on the rider. They can only work for longer-term if they help the rider retrain the elephant, meaning alter people’s behaviour.

Episodic memory: [#Wolt31] The memory in which we store the things which happened during our lives. Contrast to semantic memory, though episodic memories form links between semantic concepts. [#EricB539] Used by memorizers of long lists of numbers and such. [#Kluw52] Episodic memory is more strongly affected by emotions (also by repression!) than semantic memory! [#Kluw107] There may not be a specific episodic memory separate from semantic memory; differences seem mainly to lie in that episodic memory is relatively harder to access, perhaps because semantic memories are encoded more redundantly.[#Syed87] Calculators like Gamm recruit episodic memory for calculating tasks

EPPC: [#Kluw53] The entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex are together called EPCC; the EPCC mediates the formation of semantic memory, whereas the hippocampus coordinates the formation of eutobiographical memory. Note though that they are mediating the formation – once the memories have become ingrained sufficiently, the memories are recalled directly from the cortex without mediation from EPCC or hippocampus.

Equal-odds rule: [#EricB330] The rule that the ratio of creative hits to total output remains more or less constant over time.

Equivalence range: [#Rost102] How big the groups are in a sorting task (probably inversely related to the number of significant details perceived).

Ericsson: [#EricB692] Music students 10,000- 7500-5000, EricB692/Ericsson et al 1993.

Errors: [#NS28012012] People slow down after they have made a mistake (overlooked an item) without knowing it, seems to slow down the motor system for the visual perception to catch up and conscious processing to occur. [#RoadToExcel38] 'Errors' for learning can be induced in three ways: if there's fast feedback, self-setting higher goals and expectations. If there's slow or no feedback, model cases of experts (chess players). Third option is to compare with relevant knowledge and actively seek for discordancies [Priestley], though that only works when one has enough knowledge in the first place.

Erudition: [#Crop359] Oppenheimer impressed Groves with his erudition {EW: though erudition in itself may not have anything to do with genius; may just be great PR}

Escapism: [#Csik236] Escapism can be a motivation to concentrate on your talent area, to shut out your problems at home. Perhaps, whatever the reason, just the focus and time spent on the talent area counts.

ESM: [#Csik10] Experience Sampling Method; a method that requires people to record their thoughts, activities and mental states at random moments throughout the day.

Estrogens: [#http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/crone-mannelijkevrouwelijkehersenen.pdf] Estogens let girls spend more energy processing emotional faces, especially in their fertile period.

Ethics: [#NRC220410] Women wearing 'fake brand' sunglasses cheat more often in a game. [#Hooked9] The ethics of 'hooking' people is to help people do what they want to do but don't due to lack of a solution. Categories: peddlers, dealers, entertainers, facilitators, depending on they use it themselves (or would use it themselves) and whether they substantially improve the user's life. Note that facilitators who try to help people too much unlike themselves run a greatly increased chance of failure. Peddlers definitelt tend to lack the empathy and insights needed to create something users really want, whereas entertainers have to beware of 'finite variability' Also, one has a moral duty to keep an eye on users becoming addicted, but most users have the ability to self-regulate. Build for meaning, and you can't go wrong. Note: indetify potential (or habitual/enthusiastic) users. Look for nascent behavour among early adopters. And “What problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?” [#Seligm229] Courses in ethics may not be that effective, as the more important question is what you care about. [#HaidtH188] There are ethics of autonomy (freedom and protection from harm), commuity and divinity (though the latter two are usually correlated)

Ethnicity: [#Hatt57] Having a positive view of your own group/ethnicity helps performance, d=0.32

EURISKO: [#Ster366] A computer program that has created at least one patentable invention, as well as beaten human opponents at wargames.

Evaluation: [#Ster75] Expected evaluation seems to decrease both pleasure in the activity as well as originality, though technical quality is similar. [#Ster307] Effect seems to be greatest in shy people {EW: greater stress?} Lower-skilled people are more creative under evaluation {EW: may be greater motivation?} [#Tigg181] Even if a change is “finished” it doesn't hurt measuring every three months whether you are where you want to be. [#Hatt181] Formative evaluation (teachers filling in forms) is useful, especially when graphed. [#Nass23] Evaluating others causes stress in both evaluator and in evaluatee.

Eventism: [#Howe64] The belief that a person is formed by particular remarkable events, rather than being the consequence of repeated exposure to repetitive daily experiences, activities and routines.

Everett, Daniel: [#Greene73] Linguist, must have had somewhat strong character as he in the end, as a missionary, left the church.

Evil: [#Seligm150] Would doing evil lead to a spiral of spiritual decline? [#HaidtH74] Perpetrators almost always find that they are justified (and many victims are not wholly innocent, or at least having given some reason) Sometimes evil deeds are causde by greed/ambition, in some (very rare) cases by sadism, most often by high self-esteem which lashes out when threatened, or (when massive crimes) moral idealism, the ends justify the means. People with strong moral feelings are less concerned about procedural fairness.

Evolutionary psychology: [#Paul136] Our evolutionary past is hard to deduce from modern hunter-gatherer societies, which are themselves incredibly diverse. Moreover, many of them were once cultivators, driven off their land by other groups. And almost all of them have some kind of contact with ‘modern’ societies.

Evolutionary traps: [#NS150314] “Trapped!” If changes in the environment (for example human-made) are faster than organisms can evolve, one winds up in an evolutionary trap. “Do you prefer the thing that is worse for you? / the cues you use to make your decisions no longer lead you to the best decisions – in fact they lead you to the worst ones.”

Evolv: [http://www.evolv.net/success-stories/case-study-harte-hanks/] Uses big data to select employees better, so they yield more money

EW-V: [#EW] The relationship that low arousal means that things have low importance, high arousal means that (immediate?) action is needed, either to obtain something (positive arousal, mania, lust, greed) or to avoid/destroy something (negative arousal: fear, anger)

Exaggeration: [#EW/Kluw76] Since memory is stored in traces, would exaggeration not rather hinder memory since the original stimulus may not be recognized well? Or increase memory since one can exaggerate the main features as a kind of super-stimuli?

Exam scores: [#NS181213, RobertPlomin] Twin study: genes give 52% of difference in exam scores, shared upbringing 36%, remaining 12% by teachers and other factors.

Examinations: [#Robi26] Schools tend more and more to train their pupils to score well on examinations, even though that may lead to focusing on making tests well, and not so much as on teaching the required skills in a useful way. [#Stol144] Formal tests. Can be quite stressful to learners, teachers should give lots of smaller tests before to build confidence.

Examiner: [#Hatt181] Being familiar with one's examiner raises test scores by d=0.35, though mainly for low SES-students and/or high test difficulty {EW: stress?}.

Example: [#Howe126] One of James Mill's faults was that he criticized his son for doing things wrong, even when he himself had given the child a bad background (maths), or when he just should have given an example of how it should be done (Greek). [#Medi115] Examples can be very useful when learning; giving more examples of a concept increased recall. Brain's ability to pattern match with existing knowledge? [#Clar186] Examples are one of the most powerful tools to show conceptual borders and to build mental models, as long as you succeed in letting learners process them deeply. [#Syed103/EW] Work can be hard to excel in due to delayed feedback; but examples from previous experience (or studying afterwards your decision/product again with response) could greatly enhance learning.

Example-based learning: [#Edu] Starting with an example is easier for girls than starting with abstractions. But even boys appreciate it more! {Elise Boltjes}

Excel: [#Jurre] Excelling may make your work/research more fun. {EW; or at least, being more involved makes it more fun?}

Excellence: [#EricB754] Employing only excellent candidates in organizational positions seems to be the best long-term, even if their projects do not 'fit' in the organization. [#Int281011] “In Search of Excellence”: 2/3 of companies described as 'excellent' was in deep trouble two years later. Though some characteristics remain: a flat hierarchy, conservative financing, enough money in the till (not 'lean and mean') and a strong organisational culture. No 10-year plans, but scenarios, what can happen and how to respond to it, and where you want to be long-term.

Excitement: [#Ferr52] Don't ask yourself what you want, ask what would excite you. [#Zill124] While things like 'informational value' are most important for someone's conscious attitude, excitement has a stronger influence on subsequent action. People prefer 'serious-talk' (unpleasant, informative, exciting) over small-talk (pleasant, uninformative, unexciting) [#Hargit173] The excitement and fun in science comes from doing new things. Rowland knew the difference between staying 'in a groove' or 'in a rut' (where a new experiment isn't that exciting since you know what the result will be) – switched fields every 6 to 10 years. For Cram about 10 years. When Cram got his first molecular building set he was so excited that for three days he did not bother to get dressed. [#Nass124] Excited people fidget since blood flows to their extremities and muscles contract. They also move rapidly. Eyes constantly scan the environment. Voice higher and hallmarks of extroversion (greater range, speed, volume). Also interrupt more frequently. [#NAss143] Very excited people act without considering all the options or the consequences, greater willingness to engage in unsafe sex or morally questionable behaviour. Oriented to action rather than contenplation, a bad decision better than no decision at all; prefer active recommendations, risky alternatives. Ideal for getting people on board with your proposal. As long as there is some logic to your proposal, people will agree to it. Don't force people to read, and make explanations short. Excited people remember details but forget the big picture and will be frustrated by little obstacles, calmer persons will not 'sweat the small stuff'.

Exciting: [#Wolt19] There are two kinds of neurons: those that excite other neurons, and those that discourage other neurons from being activated.

Excursions: [#Watt56] Watt believed that it was important to give young people as many impressions as possible; that also meant going with them on excursions to see as much as possible of landscapes and foreign countries. [#C2W090411] Visits to science centres are often less productive than intended, because teachers just let the guide handle the pupils, but that person cannot effectively add to the pupil's knowledge because he/she doesn't know what they know. [thesis Maite Morentin]

Execution: [#Greene190] many people have ideas, but are afraid of executing them in any form. To prevent that for himself, Fuller created 'artifacts', a kind of prototypes to see if his ideas were wild or real.

Executive functioning: [#Feist71] Children with the highest executive functioning score best on maths tests. [#NRC200811] Children with better executive functions are more interested, more concentrated, and they like learning more.

Exercises: [#EW, following Odersky’s lectures on Scala] Exercises and answers can help compensate for poor, unclear, or deficient explanations.

Exertion: [#Parr24] Without a clear goal and a great interest in the subject area, the exertion for an academic study is too much for most people.

Exhaustion: [#Howe187] Most creative individuals seem to experience periods of exhaustion due to the effortfulness of their work {EW: is that when they persevere uninspiredly?}

Expectancy-Value theory: [#Clar346] Value has more influence on what people will do (which courses they choose) while expectancy is more related to how much success they'll have (though values also play a role there, be it weaker).

Expectations: [#Ster328] Parental expectations for educational attainment can help a child rise to a better career. [#WikiPygmalionEffect] Students being led to expect their teachers being good or bad found lessons less interesting and less-well explained by the 'bad' teachers, leaned forward less, made less eye-contact. {EW: so apparently students also spend less cognitive resources on teachers they expect to do poorly. Would a good teacher therefore also spend effort in 'reputation-management'?} [#Peal80] Expecting the best instead of the worst may help achieve your goals. <EW perhaps because focusing on fears distracts and discourages us?> [#Hatt33] A student's own prediction of performance can be a powerful hampering factor in education. Expectations of teachers are often influenced by social class, conduct, and attractiveness of the student (especially for boys). But overall, the total effect of teacher expectations seems to be relatively modest. Note though that low-expecting teachers generally expect their entire class to perform poorly, which is undesirable. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200909/the-virtue-pessimism] High expectations of benefit can backfire when you're trying to change a behaviour. [#DeMoor34] People are not simply motivated by a goal, but by expecting to reach the goal if they put in the appropriate effort. [#Will41] For results to be unexpected (hence curiosity), people need to have expectations in the first place. [#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disconfirmed_expectancy] If something is unexpected, people pay more attention and analyze better. [#Luck115] People with positive expectations (about their health, for example) tend to take better care of themselves than people with negaative expectations [EW: so the problem may be probability of success, not overconfidence]

Experience: [#Howe19] Experience should not be confused with environment, as two children raised in the same environment can experience it in very different ways. Experiences influence people directly, environments only indirectly via the experiences. [#Colv3] Experience certainly doesn't necessarily make people better at certain (or all?) aspects of their jobs; senior auditors are no more likely to detect fraud than juniors. {EW: it could be that those skills are hard to learn, or at least hard to learn naturally. You need statistics and relevant descriptors}{would the intensity of training matter?} [#EricB60] More experience doesn't always help, since the common kind of additional experience is not very educational after an acceptable level has been attained. [#EricC7] Experience does not correlate well to performance on a large variety of jobs [#VUMagazine0310] Experienced therapists are not better at treating people with OCD than last-year students. [#FelixSteemers, http://www.psy.vu.nl/nl/Images/Persbericht%20Steemers_tcm108-152793.pdf ] People start 'going in routines', courses don't help, need to continuously wonder why they are doing what they're doing and how they can do it differently, thinking about the problems of their supervisor also works. [#Catmul182] Beware of overgeneralizing from experience, especially since hindsight is not 20/20 – we often choose a story but neglect many factors.

Experience taking: [#Hooked126] People who read a story about a chatacter automatically geel what the protagonist is feeling.

Experience variety: [#EricB384] Another name for the Paracelsus-effect – more varied experience may make for better abstraction/generalization?

Experiences: [#SellHuman137] Buy experiences instead of goods; they give you something to talk about, which can boost connection with others and deepen our own identities, both of which can give satisfaction. A good salesperson may also sell 'experiences' as part of the car: emphasize the adventures you can have with it instead of the Corinthian leather.

Experiment: [#Watt41] Experimenting is also a form of observation or of gaining knowledge. [#McCo822] It's also a great way of learning. {EW: should experimenting be encouraged with an experimenting budget or such {be like GoogleTime}?} [#Villa Dárte'] Henk van Kooten keeps experimenting, learning new things, trying to experiment around the rules (why not cut off part of a face from a picture?) [#Meda74] Experiments can be Baconian “What happens if I try this”, Gallilean “To test this hypothesis, I will now” or Kantian (thought experiments: under what conditions would parallel lines cross?)

Expertise: [#Simon2013Int45] It is not always clear what constitutes the 'core' of expertise that should be practiced (say, in composing classical operas). Interestingly, top opera writers do many other related stuff, so cross-training, so to speak.[#EricB746] Expertise is always relative to the performance criteria in a certain context. [#Foer66] According to Ericsson, expertise is just lots of knowledge, pattern-based retrieval and planning mechanisms.

Expertise reversal effect: [#Clar192] Instructional methods, such as graphics, which help novice learners do nothing for domain experts and may even hurt learning!

Experts: [#Eric3] Experts do not always perform better than novices in a domain-relevant task. Presumably, the experts are better in domain-critical tasks though. Some tasks, like stock market predictions, may be impossible to develop expertise for. Experts also link a problem to their much richer store of information, and {therefore?} remember it better. Note that part of expertise may be 'bluffing' and enlarged self-confidence. [#EricB10] Experts do not seem to be mentally superior to novices outside their domain, Galton's 'heriditary genius' therefore seems quite uncertain. Differences between experts and novices nearly always reflect attributes acquired by the experts during their training.[#EricB196] Sometimes experts mainly address problems in a more systematic way than novices, and a job aid reminding novices of the desired steps may bring them quite a way towards expertise. [#EricB686] Expertise may even decrease with years of experience (so after-professional-training-forgetting). [#EricB747] Experts always need to translate their knowledge to their audience and the situation. The role of the expert is to provide us with the knowledge we could have obtained ourselves if we had spent enough time studying {EW: or provide us with a service we could have done ourselves if...} People overestimate the abilities of experts, however, dispositional attribution for having a simple, stable, controllable world. {EW: which may also be why many experts overestimate themselves} [#Tonn108] Experts can be very wrong about your talent, telling Frans Bauer that he'd never get anywhere as a singer, saying to Robert ten Brink that he didn't connect to people, or refusing to talk to DoeMaar {EW: the Cats example from The Nanny was therefore not unrealistic} [#RoadExcel4] Experts are often not better in things you expect them to be better in (professional mathematicians not scoring better than the top third of maths students), but tend to excel in the core tasks of their domain; some tasks, like forecasting, may however never be amenable to expertise. Often performance in routine cases is not much better, but experts excel at the difficult cases.(!) [#RoadExcel6] If experts disagree about the 'best' solution to a problem (like auditing), assessing expertise in a domain becomes nigh impossible. [#NS04022012] If you or a loved one has a disease, you can use Google scholar on it and contact the senior author of one of the leading articles. [#Will128] Would letting students 'perform science as a scientist' be a bad preparation for a career in science as scientists can only think like scientists after many years of training? I don't agree with Willingham, but it is a nice dispute to explore. I guess being a scientist both leads to expectations, to automatically connect the observations to existing knowledge, and to more easily ask the right questions for that area. [#Will134] Experts don't jump in with solutions, first spend more time defining the problem and seeking root causes and cures. [#EW] You can't speed up all parts of acquiring expertise, but perhaps the process of noticing the important points can be of great help already. [#Foer62] An expert agent sees a nervous twitch in a suspect, so sees the world differently {sees more or different information than a novice does} [#NS190512] Problem gamblers get a buzz from winning and shrug off losses, experts don't get a huge kick out of winning, but hate losing so-much that they are continually re-evaluating their strategies {EW: and for girls? Does it depend on odds rations success/failure?} [#Foer171] Experts train by keeping out of the autonomous stage and doing 3 things: focusing on their technique, staying goal-oriented, and getting constant and immediate feedback on their performance. Practice failing, and put yourself in the mindset of someone far more competent of the task you're trying to master. For card memorizing: try to memorize a card at every metronome click, then set metronome 10-20% faster until you stop making mistakes, making notes of cards that failed. Note that immediate (or fast) feedback is important: mammographers don't get better with time, but surgeons often do. Top memorizers approach memorization as a science {EW: girls?} They develop hypotheses about their limitations, they conduct experiments and track data, a bit like developing a piece of technology or a scientific theory. [#Nass169] If you want to make someone else seem less expert, ask factoids about your domain of specialisation.

Explaining: [#Edu] Children learn more when they explain it to others (at least their mom). Mom doesn't need to give active feedback or ask questions, just listen.

Explanatory style: [#SellHuman110] Pessimists see setbacks as permanent, personal and pervasive (in all areas) – predicts quitting sales functions quite well.

Explicit: [#Ster363] Having an explicit encoding of something (such as in writing{?}) allows more creativity – realizing that most people have two arms, one can imagine one- or three-armed people.

Explicit instruction: [#Grin114] Ninth and most efficient learning method there is.

Explorative learning: [#Grin112] Sixth of nine learning methods, explorative learning is natural when an animal explores its environment and hence knows where the trees and such are.

Exploratory behaviour: [#Stern395] Artists who do more exploratory behaviour may produce higher-quality artwork. Students taught to explore different ways to define problems may be more creative over the longer run.

Explorer: [#Ster65] Explorers tend to try different problem solving strategies, even when no shift is needed. Profit from instructions to analyze and verbalize, in contrast to assimilators.

Exposure: [#Nati124] Understanding a sentence does not necessarily mean that the vocabulary in that sentence is also learned. [#Nati138] Seeing a word does not necessarily add it to one's vocabulary; hearing and/or using it works much better {EW: giving it more attention?} [#Higbee48] Exposure (hearing Greek read to you) somewhat increases your recognition of it, even without learning intent. [#EW] Perhaps that being exposed to many ideas (reading a lot in the New Scientist, or examining all those patents) makes one more creative?

Expressive blocks: [#Adams81] Someone may not have the adequate language skill or too imprecise verbal expression to communicate his ideas to others.

Expressive subjects: [#EWL] Expressive subjects, as given in school, may not be too good to stimulate creativity, since they often are not demanding enough: “everything is nice” demotivates attention and exertion. Even improving something else (stories) is good, as long as you want something to improve.

Extermism: [NS110415ExtremismsFalseTrail] There is a correlation between extremist sympathies and being young, in full-time education, relative social isolation, and having a tendency towards depressive symptoms. Being born outside the UK, general ill health and having large social networks was correlated with more moderate views. Association with depression stronger in men, though women are as likely to have extremist views.

External motivation: [#Redirect138] Using external threats or rewards (like prison for crime) may undermine intrinsic motivation to do the right thing.

Externalizing: [#CIAch3] Using an external memory aid (such as a piece of paper) to overcome the limited size of working memory.

Extinction: [#Kluw25] Extinction is UNlearning things. May be partially mediated by the prefrontal cortex, even in EBCC. [#Tigg146] If a behaviour does not have consequences, its frequency will decrease. This is called “extinction”. For behavioural change it's rather hard to apply, as almost everything has a consequence.

Extinction-anger: [#Tigg146] If something that always worked in the past doesn't give the expected consequences anymore, we try for a while more, then get emotional (the 'burst'), then stop the behaviour. <EW: I wonder what happens if a person doesn't show the normal reaction anymore...>

Extraversion: [#WikiExtr] Extraverts tend to have a more sensitive dopamine system (so perceive rewards/pleasures as greater), however do less well in academia, since they may be bored more easily (and score lower on intelligence and 'giftedness'). [#Pers358] The younger generations seem to be getting more and more extraverted since the 60s. Not only life and soul of parties, but also more impulsive, easily bored, and placing more value on the standards of others. Societies high in extroversion have more murder, crime and unemployment. Perhaps caused my higher mobility of parents or daycare, more permissive parenting and the new emphasis on schools on “social skills.” Desired in companies, despite being less task-oriented than introverts. Extroverts are also more (overly?) optimistic than introverts. Extroversion also via TV role models? [#Nett95] Reward system is in nucleus accumbens. [#Vonk240611] Extravert people are more popular at parties: easier to talk with, talk more vividly and interestingly, laugh more, talk more about positive feelings, are more expressive, wear nicer clothes and are (incorrectly) expected to like others more. [#NRC030911] Introverts behaving like extraverts feel happier afterwards {feel through acting}, no willpower reduction. Extraverts behaving like introverts felt less happy and reduced willpower. [#NS030710] Extroverts may be extrovert because they are relatively attractive or strong, so genes switch on extraversion genes to make the most of it, or introversion genes to prevent harm being done by a high-risk strategy. [#EW] If introverted truck drivers preferred long distances, could it be that it was not just pure introversion, but that they tended to be overstimulated [arousal higher than their comfort point?]

Extremophilia: [#Pers272] Research shows that people who go through uncomfortable and/or dangerous situations are physically and mentally healthier afterwards, as well as more successful (and they cherish the memory too!) But they are perhaps also basically less extroverted.

Extrinsic motivators: [#Colv192] Some extrinsic motivators enhance creativity: constructive, non-threatening and work-focused (not person-focused) feedback helps creativity. Recognition that confirms competence also helps. And perhaps even the right kinds of external rewards, such as those involving more time or resources to pursue exciting ideas. Even parents can enforce practice, but for Bloom's performers they did that interestingly by threatening to sell the piano, which would never work if children hated piano lessons. Slowly, extrinsic motivators become less important as intrinsic motivators became stronger. [#EricB466] Society can stimulate some kinds of performance. In China, playing the piano well makes a girl more marriageable to a higher-class family. [#EW] Extrinsic motivators, if they're big, can cause stress and thereby probably decrease enjoyment and intrinsic motivation. [#Busa5] Hans Warren may want to not care about what people think, but considers recognition and admiration everything for an artist. [#Ster303] Extrinsic motivators may inhibit creativity by producing divided attention, making people look for the fastest/easiest solution to get what they want (such as Laura's competitiveness). People enjoying the task will seek more solutions. Even when extrinsic motivation seems to increase creativity, it seems to do so only when people get an algorithm for producing 'creative work' -which actually makes them more conforming! One can be immunized to the effects of extrinsic motivation by special training. Controlling extrinsic motivation is usually detrimental to creativity, informational/enabling extrinsic motivation though can help. [#Ster412] May extrinsic motivation decrease intrinsic motivation due to people feeling less control / locus of control shifted outside? [#Csik34] Art students motivated by fame or money usually stop being artists after graduating, unless they are immediately successful. [#Tigg222] Physical rewards are more prone to this overcompensation than social rewards. Having an information-function in the reward can help too. [#Ryan2000] extrinsic motivation is doing something because it leads to seperable rewards. Note that attitude towards a task is not only determined due to it being extrinsically motivated; can be resentment or with acceptance of the value.

Extrinsic rewards: [#Csik137] The importance of intrinsic rewards is negatively correlated to the importance of material extrinsic rewards (jobs, career, car), but positively correlated to the importance of social extrinsic rewards (impressing people). The two kinds of extrinsic rewards are themselves not correlated! [#Hatt175] Extrinsic rewards have a negative effect on task performance (d=-0.34) Also undermine intrinsic motivation, especially for interesting tasks (d=-0.68) Even worse when used in a controlling way “You have performed as you should have performed” Verbal rewards slightly increase intrinsic motivation though.

Extroversion: [#Zill128] Extroversion leads people to judge pleasant TV-sequences higher, though there is no effect on the judgement of unpleasant or neutral TV-sequences. [#Nass69] Extroverted voices are associated with higher volume, speed and frequency range.

Eye contact: [#NS010406] Eye contact (just like motherese) are useful for getting attention of babies <of adults too? Toastmasters?> [#Imagine150] Making eye contact with strangers may open the door slowly to talking to one another and idea exchange (so Steve Jobs moved everything to the middle of the building, including the toilets).

Eyes: [#Sidis] The most important thing that a liberal education can give is an objective view of reality, without either undue negativism, wishful thinking, or prejudice and superstitions.

Faas, Erik: [#Strien11] Wrote his PhD thesis on creativity in science.

Face recognition: [#NS150912] Face recognition generally takes place in the fusiform gyrus and the occipital face area. Some people are face blind, but about 1 in 50 people are 'superrecognizers'. {Useful for police jobs; but occasionally, like Brada, they are also obsessed with faces and watch youtubes and such obsessively} [#NS160917FirstContactWithATrappedBrain] face recognition is an automatic brain response, you don't have to be conscious to do it.

Faces: [#NS240514] Seeing faces (at least of friends?) leads to activation of the nucleus accumbens. People with the greatest response tend also to be the greatest social media users. [#NS120817FacingUpToFirstImpressions]. Attractiveness aside, our first impressions fall along two axes: friend or foe, and powerful-or-no.

Facilitate: [#Robi181] The third role of mentors, giving the mentee resources (teaching things, opening doors, etcetera).

Failure: [#Colv189] Failing repeatedly while trying to master a task isn't fun (or should not be). Why do people persist? {EW: well, what about fruit machine gamblers? They fail a lot, but enjoy the chance of winning} [#Dwec4] Some children really like a challenge or think they're learning something when they fail. But fixed-mindset people and growth-mindset people respond differently: the 'fixeds' stop trying, the 'growths' double their efforts. [#Pers247] Everyone fails, but the successful objectively analyze what went wrong and how they can improve in future. Sometimes it even means transforming your personality to be able to get what you want. [#Ferr279] If you don't fail, you're not working on hard-enough projects. [#ArnoI] Failure can follow from trying to change too radically too quickly, the discouragement of friends, and failure to allot time to it. [#Syed125] When a student hits a long “You're on the right track. It's not the mistakes, it's how you respond to them”. [#Switch162] Failure will trigger the flight reaction, therefore it's needed to create in you and your audience the expectation of failure and challenges. [#Imagine242] Most Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have failed with at least one previous startup. Above door of drama school “FAIL BIG”. [#Greene82] Henry Ford was good at learning from failure, both from his failure when trying to make his automobile serve too many consumer needs, and his failure to keep money lenders from polluting his work with their mediocre ideas. Mistakes and failures are part of your education. Hard to get from people directly, as they are generally political with their praise and criticism. The first kind of failure comes because you are afraid, or because you wait for the perfect time. You can't learn anything from this failure. It's actually a curse to have everything go right at your first attempt, as you don't realize luck played a role. [#Burkeman160] Scientists, if an experiment fails, generally start by blaming the method and the apparatus and try to reproduce their results. If that does not work, they abandon the experiment and start another one. [#Schmid238] Failed projects usually yield valuable technical, user and market insight, parts can usually be reused. Also important not to punish the failing team, as that gives a bad message to the rest of the organisation. And “if you’re thinking big enough, it’s hard to fail completely”

Fair: [#McGraw4] Quite some things in life are not fair (or people don't perceive them as fair). But complaining about fairness won't help, or asking 'why', you have to deal with reality. You need a strategy, with clearly defined objectives.

Faith: [#EW] Will a family of strong faith ever give rise to true curiosity and genius? [#Syed141/EW] Some sporters have more faith because they believe God to be on their side – it may help reduce nervousness and focus attention on the work to be done. This may be due to a placebo effect (which by itself is influenced by cues such as colour, price, credible authority figures, the elaborateness of the procedure, etc.) More than half the English table tennis team was using Peale in the mid-80s. [#Greene179] You must havr patience and faith that what you are doing will yield something important. (may need to have an obsessive element?).  [#EW/Pealep130] Being fascinated by a problem probably also requires that you believe you can solve it!

False hope syndrome: [#Pers99] The phenomenon in which people tend to fail to adhere to for example fitness programs because they underestimate the difficulties and investments and time duration to reach the goal.

False memories: [#NS240813] False memories are easy to implant – give a fake personality test and tell participants that such and so likely happened when they were young [NS101015] or that a parent told them, and ask them to elaborate and imagine it.Works for about 1/3rd of people, when done over repeated sessions

False self: [#Greene310] The accumulation of all voices from parents and society about what you should be, or yourself to deny unflattering truths.

Falsification: [#Strien65] In psychological experiments, scientists don't falsify more than clergymen; and sometimes verification is a more efficient strategy anyway [EW: doctor – dangerous. Better?] Most scientists don't like to falsify their own work, perhaps that was one of the strengths of the Watson-Crick couple?

Fame: [#Tonn11] Do you want fame, or something else? Wealth, popularity, fame and power are not always compatible. Fame does not necessarily require talent; it does however require a large ego, a helping of vanity, an iron will, the ability to not get discouraged, and a sprinkling of opportunism. Fame is also addictive, and the fall from grace can be awful. The important victory is the daily victory over yourself, to continue training while others lie in their cozy warm beds. [#Tonn15] Many famous people, as children or teenagers, were daydreaming about fame and success, not specifically as a singer or whatever, but fame in general. And to be modest and self-effacing does not really help. Even Oprah was slightly unethical about using a miss crown she actually had not deserved. Fame is also about being a 'product'. How the market sees you is not necessarily how you see yourself (Katja Schuurman), but you need to find a 'gap in the market', and use your strengths and unique selling points('trademark') to create yourself an imago. And {like general talent} stubbornness and persistence can help. [#Tonn117] Relations are more difficult when you're famous {EW: at least when you're female?} [#Psy07/08-2004] Students mostly interested in fame and fortune get lower results than students having more altruistic life goals. [#Hargit206] Rosalyn Yalow was turned down as a patient by a hospital whose parent university had awarded her an honorary degree, as they feared she would be a burden to the hospital. When Elizabeth II visited Germany, leading tennis players were at the dinner, but not a single scientist. [#SimonB126] Fame can also be a stressor – jabs from detractors and critics, and also not always very nice to see you the way that others see you. Fame increases the number of times you use the word 'I'

Familiarity: [#EricB672] The cortex is more active when viewing familiar movements (so ballet dancers show greater activation when watching ballet than capoeira). [#GladT212] Unfamiliar/unexpected things, discordant details are most often forgotten unless they are very striking. [#Kluw94] Things that previously experienced are preferred over new things, even if they are not explicitly recognized. [#EW] Familiarity may also make us underestimate risks (or rewards?) [#Foer85] Many of our daily interactions are guided by implicit learning, not by explicit memory (EP greeting his neighbours, since they seemed nice [as they were familiar]) [#Higbee47] The more familiar a subject is, the easier is it to remember new things about it.

Familiarity effect: [Wise78] We tend to prefer things that we have seen before, even if we do not recognize them.

Family: [#Robi141] Family can exert smaller or bigger pressure on persons to choose the safe, conventional way. [#EduNRC051106] Families can be positional (“because I say so!”) or personal (negotiations, emotions. “if you don't kiss grandpa he'll feel sad”). Positional children fare badly with personal-trained teachers.

Family check-up: [#NRC010211] Preventing problem behaviour by giving parents feedback and training works much better than waiting till the full-blown problems occur and put the youth toether in talk groups, where they learn more from each other's bad behaviour than from the therapists's wise words.

Fandom: [#EW] Would fandom imply that someone takes this or that person as his or her role model? Or is opposite-sex fandom mainly related to attraction?

Fantasizing: [#Pers98] Frequently fantasizing about what you want and how great your life will be when you have achieved it is much less effective than merely having a clear goal and expecting to achieve it.

Fantasy gap: [#NS290314, MyPrecious] There is a growing discrepancy between young people's desire to own expensive things and their willingness to do the work to earn them. Researchers call this 'the fantasy gap'. This is because our materialistic desires are not dictated by what we need, but by what those around us have.

Far-transfer: [#Clar262] Far transfer can be increased by supplying varied examples and practice (but do demand active learner processing to find the common principles). Varied worked examples work better than varied problems that the learners have to solve for themselves, as they need less cognitive load (varied problems even fare worst – too high load, in any case for novice learners) [#Will101] Transfer is hampered by the complexity of a procedure/solution.

Faraday, Michael: [#Crop137] One of the few exceptions to the rule that all great scientists came from middle-class backgrounds. Had strong, supportive mother, was member of Sandemanian church, which emphasized love, discipline and community. Apprenticed to French refugee bookbinder George Riebau, which allowed/encouraged Faraday to read. Also went to evening lectures at Royal Society {EW: so also made contact with other people}. Had heat of volcano in him 'excitable and fiery nature', but sweet manner due to enormous self-discipline. Bit of an idealist, found the book-trade vicious and selfish, and felt that dedication to science made one amiable and liberal. Went on European tour with Davy, meeting the foremost European scientists, Davy himself freely discussing everything about science with his assistant. Became famous by elaborating on Oersted's experiment, and paved the way for electrical motors, though he did not pursue them himself. Very meticulous in describing and drawing his experiments. Founded electrochemistry, and named cations and anions with William Whewell, who had a great taste in choosing names. Did suffer from bouts of forgetfulness and depression {EW: just depression, which may have led to forgetfulness? Exhaustion/strong variation of neuromodulators?} One of crowning achievements inspired by letter from Thomson, set him to experiment with magnetized dielectric. Was very imaginative person, but placed great emphasis on facts, especially on seeing facts for himself. Some of his ideas were rejected, because he couldn't speak them in the commonly accepted mathematical language. His wife was maternal and supporting and took care he got his meals, he was childless but very fond of children, and still a bit of a child himself. Also was a great lecturer, took the preparations of them very seriously; his Christmas lecture on a candle is still famous. Also expressed his emotions in his laboratory notebook “All this is but a dream”. Was not well able to delegate work to assistants, had to do everything himself. Later in life consciously suppressed his gregarious nature and became a bit of a recluse to do science. Also wrote letters, had at least one good correspondent. [#Greene96] As a child, had an endless hunger for knowledge, always asking questions about nature. Would listen to lectures by popular scientist John Tatum, write out key words, sketch out various instruments, diagram the experiment, and at home work it out into a chapter. Davy was role model as Davy also lacked any solid formal education. (Davy also had a flair for the dramatic, very good for situational interest). When assisting Davy, did more than was asked for. Got a glimpse from how Davy's mind worked, and it was fascinating. [#Greene198] Took lessons in drawing and painting early in his career, so he could recreate the experiments. [#Strien264] Was very good in conceiving and giving 'demonstration' experiments – could spend hours preparing them, but they also gave him new ideas. [#245] Had the complementary properties of a near obsessive need for certainty and order, and an open eye for unexpected observations.

Fashions: [#Strien197/EW] In psychology, worldviews don't generally succeed one another because they give better predictions, but because they become fashionable (new! Better in line with the spirit of the times!) Though of course other sciences also have fashions in the sense of what approach is popular for solving problems (Eas, GWAS).

Fasting: [#NS171112] Caloric restriction increases the health span, but not life span, of primates. Fast starts 10-12 hours after a meal. High protein intake correlates to cancer. 48 hour fast in combination with radiation therapy is more effective at killing tumors. 5:2 fasts (on 2 days, 600 calorie meals) may also work. Fasting becomes less annoying the better you get used to it, and also more effective healthwise. Fasting also helps asthma. Fasting (alternate-day fasting) may also boost production of neurotropic factor. But may reduce heart's ability to pump blood. [#NS050817LearnBetterByCountingYourCalories]  Both fasting and a low-calorie diet may decrease levels of kynurenic acid, which activates neurons involved in learning (otherwise decreasing kynurenic acid has the same effect). Note that strong hunger impairs learning.

Fat: [#NS170617TheFireInside] Fat stores inflammatory cytokines, if there is too much fat, they can seep out, leading to ongoing, low level inflammation. [#NS071017AntidepressantHelpsMiceBurnBellyFat] macrophages in belly fat become inflamed as we get older; this may also be why it becomes harder to lose then, catecholamine signalling going down. Clorgyline helps against it

Fathers: [#Flouri, Buchanan] the more 'betrokken' a father is when children are 7, the better school performance, the less psychological problems for daughters and police contact for sons. Ideal father reads to children, goes out with them, is interested in their mental development. Also valid if father is not biological father or does not live with mother. Www.dfes.gov.uk/dadandsons [#NRC150413] When parents are separated, children score lower on Cito; but of all separated families, children who live with their father score highest. (data: CBS)

Fatigue: [#Pers277] Best way to combat fatigue is to gradually increase physical and social activities {EW: and Maria?}. [#Loeh33] Fatigue has a cascade effect, making your mood worse leading to tension leading to more fatigue, and also makes it harder to concentrate. [#McGon71] Fatigue is mostly in the mind, our body can endure much more. [#NS151016DeadOnYourFeet?] Fatigue is not the same as tiredness (which is that you can easily fall asleep). Linked to being fat, lack of exercise, too much sugar/too little fruits and vegetables, and chronic low-level inflammation. Fasting can also help against fatigue.

Faustian pact: [#Strien295] Geniuses tend to be seduced to agree on a 'Faustian pact' at the moment they definitely find their destination; (which usually is the first big breakthrough that is also publicly acknowledged{so environment helps!}) It also seems to cause a narcissistic tendency to see oneself and one's work as 'special', and to see one as having the _right_ for all freedom. Many creative minds had a purely instrumental view of their environment, were parasites on friends and colleagues and dropped them the second that they did not need them anymore. “One law for the lion and ox is oppression” {EW: lower agreeableness?}

Favour: [#Nass183] Having received a favour from a computer makes a counter-task also more fun and interesting (?so good relationships between teachers and students?). Part of a favour is not only that it is helpful, but also making clear that you worked very hard. If you do the inverse, (unhelpful and incompetent/lazy), people will take revenge. Also leads to disliking the task more.

Fear: [#Sidis] Fear is present in all animals, and in people it discourages frankness, openmindedness and independence. Fear of losing face is especially strong, and can make society relatively inpenetrable for new ideas. [#Howe126] JSMill's education was one of fear rather than of love, him being too afraid of his dominating father to make decisions for himself. {new ideas-mostly punished?}[#Robi139] Fear can be the greatest obstacle to achieving your goals, be aware of anti-fear techniques (like of Susan Jeffers). [#Gold36] Fear leads to paralysis and denial if no plan of action is presented, but to action if there IS a plan of action. [#EW] Persons who are predictable are feared (and possibly loved) less. [#Lieb120] Fear makes people more gregarious. [#Tonn111] Marischka Hulscher considered that the worst that could happen was to lose face, and she decided she could live with that. [#GiftedMusicPres] Fear of displaying ones efforts openly, because of fear of being seen as unmusical or incompetent. [#Int04052012-LourensNonkes] Rats with the short variant of SSR can be better trained to overcome their fear by focusing at the same time on something they do like, than letting people get acquainted with the stimulus in a safe environment. [#NS090313] Fear is initially detected in subconscious parts of our brain, then it signals the amygdala, which directs our attention to the threatening stimulus and gives the feeling of fear. Without the amygdala, the arousal can be misinterpreted as excitement. Note though that internal threats (like air rich in CO2) use a different mechanism (blood acidity?) and can even cause panic without interference of the amygdala. The amygdala can then even dampen fear due to true assessment of the situation (researchers are here, you're safe). Amygdala also helps learn memories of fear. Amygdala also deals with social behaviour, when someone is not trustworthy, or when to stay reticent. Also her 'personal space' is extremely small. [#Int281011] Fear follows an inverse U-curve, will automatically disappear if you hang in it for long enough. Without exposure to a situation, fear does not diminish. [#NS201012] Lab-raised monkeys don't fear snakes, but if they see wild monkeys react to one, they fear it next time. !But not every fear can be learned like this, so something about snakes must be preprogrammed! [#Adams128] Your fear for seeming ignorant may diminish when you realize that other people are ignorant too. Other people have emotions and silly ideas as well. [#HayesS37] Feeding fear (or pain) makes it stronger and more controlling your life (EW: because you get more accustomed to avoidance behaviors, they become more automatic?). [#NS281017DogsReallyCanSmellYourFear] Dogs, when smelling fear, also become more fearful: having higher heart rates, seeking more reassurance from their owners, and make less social contact with strangers.

Fear of failure: [#Robi27] Young children are in most cases not yet afraid to fail. {EW: really? And if so... why? Not disapproved enough by their parents yet / Gervaas-Stach?} But great fear of failure may hamper creativity. [#Pers10] Those most successful in business tend to fear public failure least. But often fear of failure is caused by lack of self-esteem, so do not ignore that... [#NRC150111] Fear of failure decreases if students spend 10 minutes in advance writing elaborately about their feelings and thoughts about the exam. [#Pers13/EW] Fear of failure/rejection stops many from trying things, yet it seems irrational since people are generally not expelled from the community by trying; trying is usually a good gamble.

Fear of heights: [#NS200713] Fear of heights seems to come into being after babies learn to crawl; key may be that moving yourself around space makes babies learn to use their peripheral vision to correct balance.

Fearfulness: [#Pers13] Fearfulness at five years seems to be the best predictor of lack of sporting success later. [#C2W_carriere_2013] Cees Dekker: physicst switched to biology, was a 'groentje' there, but what you don't know, you can learn (and get good postdocs, for which is physics reputation helped\]

Features: [#Kluw89] An object may be represented in memory as a combination of its features (so deep processing accesses more and more fundamental features?)

Feedback: [#Colv193] Feedback from coaches can be motivating. [#Coyl91] Feedback from yourself is critically important to observe (hearing when you hit a bad note) [#EricB506] Frequent feedback is more useful for short-term learning, infrequent feedback more useful for long-term learning [#Schm214] Such as 'fading' feedback. The causes seem unclear (perhaps people pay less attention to their own kinesthetic feedback?, or the effect is in some weird way similar to the massed practice effect). [#Clar214] Provide explanatory feedback (the reason why something is incorrect, instead of merely saying it is incorrect). But also explain why something is correct (helps if people gamble;) ) Feedback can be intrinsic or instructional, Clark encourages adding the instructional feedback, though she doesn't give any research as evidence. {she likes the role of the trainer?} [#Kluw245] Delayed feedback drastically reduces learning, so animal trainers usually give immediate promts “excellent”, to bridge the delay until the primary reinforcer (food pellets?) are applied. [#Stol66] Fifth of six adult learning principles. Given either by instructor or environment. Feedback is beneficial if it is considered as directed toward the task, bad if the learner considers it criticism of him/herself. Immediate feedback good for simple tasks, delayed feedback for complex tasks (especially just before the next attempt is useful, as it also is handy for refreshing the knowledge then). Sufficient, immediate feedback relieves stress. Frequent and specific feedback is good, but don't overload the learner with details. [#Simo194] In many cases it is unknown which factors contribute to the success or failure of an artistic or scientific product, and besides the human mind is extremely bad at recognizing and dealing with multiple factors in complex interrelations. And yes/no feedback is far too simple for the creator to learn why a masterpiece is a masterpiece. [#Hatt4] Feedback is one of the most important correlates for successful teaching, but with the caveat that it only works if the teacher has the right mindset about students (believing in their potential), and note that feedback from classmates (80% of feedback in elementary schools) can also be very wrong (80% of that 80%). And you also need sufficiently challenging goals! Most important is that teachers increase the feedback they get from their pupils about their teaching. More challenging tasks require more feedback from the teacher. [#Hatt173] Most important feedback is the feedback from student to teacher – what they know, what are their misconceptions, when they are not engaged. Most effective: providing cues or reinforcement to the learner, are in the form of video, audio, or computer-assisted feedback, or relate feedback to learning goals. Teachers claim to give feedback all the time, in reality it is only moments, if at all, and most feedback students receive is from peers – and is incorrect. Programmed instruction, praise, punishment and external rewards are least effective as feedback for enhancing achievement. Feedback is most effective when goals are specific and challenging but task complexity is low, and when the perceived threat to self-esteem is low. Also more effective when it provides feedback on correct rather than incorrect responses. If students are not at all proficient in something, instruction is called for; feedback is more for sharpening concepts that are already grasped quite well. [#Syed98] Top players try to maximize feedback: by having clear goals and comparing their performance with it, by having coaches, and if possibly by videoing/recording their performance so they can also have a third-person view. [#EricsD437] Feedback can be low-fidelity and high-fidelity (non-realistic situation vs realistic situation). [#EW250112] Would feedback equal to change and equal to something that produces attention, and hence motivation? [Attentional theory of motivation] [#Interm091211] Most people forget or discount negative feedback easily, narcissists will even thirst for your blood if you give it publicly. Only solution: package it in plenty of positive feedback. [#NS200811] Feedback can be increased by special means, like using a 'hirsute swimsuit' with extra long hairs to make swimmers more sensitive to the flow of water. [#Newport65] Alex Berger aggressively sought feedback on his drafts. [#Int030812/Vonk/LeonardMartin] To compensate for our current delayed feedback we develop neuroses ('we are great') or dwell on the past, instead of being here and now. [#http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/06/15/how-to-use-feedback/] Watch what people do, how they act, and take their explanations with a grain of salt. Second: feedback can be at the wrong level; correcting typos while the writing needs to be less boring. [#GeoWissen09] MartinKorte: Teachers should also indicate what went well, children only start to profit from negative feedback from age 13 (at least, before that negative feedback only acts on the emotions; after that, it will also be processed in parts that analyze and correct errors). [#Greene159] Reassure people that you want their honest criticisms about our behaviour, then ask for their opinion. Helps develop the ability to see ourselves as we really are (or at least, are perceived...) [#NS240813] In basketball can be automated with a sleeve that looks at optimal angle (Cynthia Kuo, Vibrado). [#Higbee81] Feedback helps sustain interest. [#NS101015] Someone has designed a vest that gives tactile feedback (vibrating) on airplane sensors – helps people better pillot a plane. Coul it also be used for code inspections?Or bioinf? VEST [#Seligm69] Would 360 degree positive feedback/on strengths be necessary for people to change? [#Catmul] “You need to be wrong as fast as you can” (EW: looks against planning and preparation. Depends on expertise/knowledge/knowable] [103] A good note says what is wrong, what ismissing, what isn’t clear, what doesn’t make sense. A good note is timely, good note does not make demands. May include a proposed fix, but more as example than as required way to go. Good note is specific. [#https://feelinggood.com/science-behind-t-e-a-m-therapy/] Patients tend to be more honest in written feedback than face-to-face, in any case when they come voluntarily, without a hidden (or semi-open) agenda.

Feeling: [#Mill77] Would lack of feeling (or, acknowledging ones own feelings) play a part in going a wrong course in life which makes one depressed? [#EW] In general, changing one’s behaviour can best be achieved by changing one’s feelings on a certain situation, by coupling the desired situation to strong positive feelings. [#Tigg76] Planning a change that feels bad doesn't have much chance: a change must feel good too. [#Redirect27] Most people are pretty good at knowing how they feel at a certain point in time, but pretty bad at knowing why they feel that way. [#McGon103/EW] Feeling good about yourself may make you more likely to take risks (like speeding)

Feringa, Ben: [#C2W211016DeMoleculaireWereldIsOneindig] Discovered rotation when he wanted to make molecular-scale data storage, and the chirality stayed the same while they were certain that it was transforming. Father was also greatly interested in nature and discussed questions like how wheat can grow from a seed with his son. Mentor was Wijnberg, who had received his education in the USA, and was used to ‘the lat hoog leggen’, ‘second to none’. [RijksUniversiteitGroningenNobelprijsVoorBenFeringa] Praises the willingness of people to seek scientific challenges and the ability to ask “what is the reak question here?”

Fermi, Enrico: [#Crop344] Youngest of three children, mother schoolteacher, father in railroad administration. Very strong mother, high devotion, overstressed sense of duty and inflexible integrity. Set high moral and intellectual standards to herself and others. Lost brother and favourite playmate, Guilio, and immersed himself {further?} into maths and physics after that. Colleague of father, Adolfo Amidei, lent him book on geometry and was impressed by Enrico's mastery of it after two months. Lent him more and more books. Fermi stored all in memory (though he repeated the chapters mentally on long train voyages). Could store or 'derive easily enough' al physics and maths he read. Fermi was sent to top school of Italy, but even there stood out. When returning to Rome found other mentor, who sent him on scholarships to Europe, first to Born's institute, where he did not feel at home, then to Ehrenfest in Leiden, where he learned lots from Ehrenfest's encyclopedic knowledge in physics. Both was an excellent teacher (and also loved to teach), and read the current physics journals, thinking deeply about what he read, assimilating knowledge and often adding something new. {his love of teaching may have led to so many Nobel prize winners among his students?} Was infallible in theoretical matters, was in a relaxed and unpretentious way completely dominant. Fermi always aimed for the concrete and avoided the abstract. Was able to analyze every problem into its essentials. Tended to be the leader, even in recreational activities {self-confidence?} Though not the paragon of physical prowess (rounded shoulders, neck craned forward). Not the overwhelming halo of importance and solemnity expected of a full professor. /written down in 'Atoms in the family'/ His neutrino-theory was rejected by Nature as being too speculative. Used the help of another professor to construct his own neutron source, when decided to do some experiments himself. Worked systematically (H, Li, Be...) but almost gave up, fortunately encountered that F was activated. Tried to place lead (though Fermi usually wasn't apparently very precise on minor measuments), but then took paraffin instead; which was supreme intuition (though perhaps since the wooden tables worked much better than the marble ones). Mistakenly assumed to have found elements 93 and 94, possibly because he had not employed a good chemist. Was apolitical but ambitious, and accepted invitations to Fascist societies though no active member. However, fled Italy in 1938 as soon as possible after antisemitic laws came into effect (as his wife was Jewish). Was a kind of omnibus division in Los Alamos, as he could help with miscellaneous problems due to his vast range of physics knowledge. Tended to go from field to field, liked to pioneer, not to dig in a mature field. [#Wiki] From the time he was a boy, Fermi meticulously recorded his calculations in notebooks, and later used them to solve many new problems that he encountered based on these earlier known problems. [#Hargit157] Fermi came to Rome in 1927, looking for students. Had small group of students, gave them private lessons two or three times a week. Kept that practice for years, even at Columbia and Chicago. Was however rather ruthless in choosing his students, was willing to devote an endless amount of time and patience in them and did not want to see his efforts wasted. After graduation, Fermi suggested research topics to Segre but also encouraged him to find his own path. Slow neutrons were discovered in one day: radioactivity was greatly increased with paraffin in front of the substance, Fermi and his students went for lunch and then siesta, and then Fermi said “I know” (enormous knowledge + siesta). [#Zucker101] Mentor of 6 future Nobel laureates: Segre, Chamberlain, Lee, Yang, Bloch and Bethe.

Fernandez, Teresita: [#Greene153] Experimented with art at night, so she could make mistakes, be fearless and take chances (also, studio was quite peaceful at night, so she could focus). Hid how many hours she had worked on those sculptures, since people wanted to believe in miracles. But since she was a woman, had to develop a style to be assertive and confident, yet speak with mystery about her work. Her public persona also became a work of art – malleable.?Lesson that people will always make faulty conclusions about you, even if you are yourself, so mold your public persona to control what people think of you.

Feynman technique: [# http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/10/26/mastering-linear-algebra-in-10-days-astounding-experiments-in-ultra-learning/ ] Get a piece of paper 1. Write at the top the idea or process you want to understand 2. Explain the idea, as if you were teaching it to someone else 3. For Ideas You Don’t Get At All The way I handle this is to go through the technique but have the textbook open to the chapter explaining that concept. Then I go through and meticulously copy both the author’s explanation, but also try to elaborate and clarify it for myself. This “guided” Feynman can be useful when trying to write anything on your own would be impossible. Understanding is helped by trying to find analogies, visualisation, simplification [EW: and breaks between tries?]

Feynman, Richard: [#Crop376] Feynman sought out gamblers, con artists, and beautiful women. Tall, handsome, skilled dancer and drummer, never-ending fund of entertaining stories – the beautiful women were often willing. Also drew (with a preference for topless models). His first love, Arline, reproached him for worrying about what other people would think of him (Pecans to you!). Always deconstructed and reconstructed theories 'What I cannot create, I cannot understand'. Did not fear doubt and uncertainty; doubt was even his motivation. Father, Melville, always wanted to become a scientist but didn't have the means for it “If it's a boy, he'll be a scientist.” Father didn't know the facts, but had a complete understanding of the deeper flavour of science. Read the Encyclopedia Brittanica to his son, explaining everything – strove to translate everything he read into understandable things. Mother had a wonderful sense of humor. Joined a honors physics course in high school, by Abram Bader, who had not got his PhD because money had run out, but well-informed and sympathetic teacher who gave Richard extra material. Meandered at university, eliminating maths due to its boring career prospects (teaching maths or becoming an actuary) before ending up in physics. Good choice as MIT had a strong physics department. With friend, decided to follow course required of seniors and graduate students in their sophomore (2nd) year. Both had read and thoroughly discussed books on quantum mechanics and relativity on their own. Teacher, Philip Morse, offered to teach them a small private course, and set them to work on some small research projects. When Feynman found a precursor to Dirac's equation, he felt for the first time the kick in the discovery. His senior thesis (on the expansion of quartz) was ingenious and novel, and was published (in abbreviated form) in the major physics journal. Was 'sent away' from MIT since Feynman thought it was the best place for science and engineering. Was first scheduled with Wigner, but wound up with Wheeler, always impeccably dressed but willing to look at any wild problem. Not all investigations were fruitful, but Feynman did find a very elegant way to rewrite quantum mechanics. Tended to treat all physicists on equal footing, could say ýou'r crazy' to his superior. Couldn't stand confinement very well, specializing in picking locks and opening safes. Was extremely clear, a good teacher, good relations with everyone. Feynman got multiple offers, but took Cornell's one to be with Bethe {perhaps he found he could get along better with an informal, tolerant person such as Bethe} First had mental block at Cornell (his wife had died earlier), though female students were a distraction. Block lifted when he saw a wobbling plate and described its equations of motion. Just did it for pure fun, but it helped him get into the groove again. Did not get his QED-theory accepted at first because he used pictures and only wrote down intermediate results, not mathematically subsequent and rigorous. Moved to CalTech (was lured by smart professor with trips to girls and casinos). Gave up alcohol when he discovered he was slipping into alcoholism and he didn't want to destroy his brain. Feynman thought up the V-A theory (independently of some others) based on new experimental results that a symmetry law was broken, felt joy in 'knowing something that nobody else knew'. Visualized what happened if you were an electron approaching a nucleus at high speed and postulated subparts of hadrons – but Gell-mann's quarks were more detailed, weird, and accurate; Feynman took some years to accept it. Somewhat reluctantly accepted invitation to investigate shuttle disaster, though prodded/stroked by his wife's confidence in him. First talked to a friend of a friend on shuttle engine design. Note that major general was Feynman's only ally in the commission, as the astronauts refused to be disloyal to NASA. Was incensed that PR had been considered more important than reality at NASA. Never attended board meetings, avoided committees, did not seek research grants and accepted very few PhD-students. Did teach course in Physics X though, and was a great teacher in introductory physics, being convinced that teaching needed eloquence, drama, surprise and comedy. {EW: will insure attention; but also proper learning?} Feynman was curious about everything, and delighted in 'being something he was not.'; bongo drumming, learned some biology and hired himself out as biology TA during a sabbatical, worked as ordinary staffer in computer company. [#video, pleasure of finding things out] Father: let's look at this like a Martian would do. Read Dirac's book (though he didn't fully understand it at first) 'some new ideas are here needed' (inspiring!) Also knows that knowing the name of something learns you nothing about the thing itself. [#NS170410] People warned journalist against seeing him. Could be blunt - “While you're talking, you're not learning anything”

FFA: [#EricB667] Fusiform face area, the right FFA activates when seeing faces, though it also lights up in experts in different areas (like birds, cars) when they see a domain stimulus. It may therefore not be programmed for faces, but for important, individual stimuli. (“Visual stimuli classifyable at the individual level”). If a face is upside-down, however, it is more treated like an object (object regions light up much stronger than for 'upright' faces)

Fiction: [#Sidis] Should we tell our children fairy tales? Or fill their minds with religious prayers and superstitions? {EW: the irony here is that Sidis himself uses many mythological metaphors, and his story would be hard to comprehend for people with a purely 'factual' education.} [#NS121013] “read your way to being a nicer person” - reading literary fiction temporarily enhances your ability to empathize with others (or at least recognize facial emotions).

Field articulation: [#Rost107] A visuo-spatial skill that seems to correlate to field-independence (finding hidden figures), surgical skill {and g?}

Field creation: [#Simon2013Int45] Galileo created a new field, so not the 10,000 hour rule.

Field density: [#EW] Field density can help creativity/excellence. See Florence, or manga… The reverse also goes; there being too few cheminformaticians, their interests being too diverse and their contacts almost non-existent, a field can disintegrate, not being sustainable.

Field-dependence/independence: [#http://social.jrank.org/pages/147/Cognitive-Style-Field-Dependence-Field-Independence.html] Field dependents have more trouble getting a signal hidden in a background, but often have better social skills and blend in easier in groups. In schools they need a smaller and really well-structured class to function well.

Fields: [#Ster315] While a domain is a collection of knowledge and procedures (for example, physics) {the memes?}, the field is the people-part of it: the professors, the teachers, the textbook authors, the students, etcetera. The field determines which ideas in the domain are saved and which are discarded. [#Csik30] Fields may attract interest because they are visible, lucrative or convey high status, or because they are seen as glamorous (AI?), or because they have intrinsic rewards (such as the arts). Of course, it never hurts if there are good career prospects after training.

Fight-or-flight-response: [#Nass35] ForF-response often lets people seek something to do, fast action, or aggressive action/trying to alter the situation. [#McGon33] Makes us more impulsive.

Fill-in-learning: (?) [#Grin108] A behaviour that is natural, but is only coupled to the right stimulus by exposure to the environment (for example Lorenz' goslings). Second of nine learning methods.

Financial sector: [#NRC050913/ChristianeKneer] The deregulation in the financial sector seems coupled to lower productivity gain in high-tech companies

Finite-state-machine: [#Laird46] Idea: a machine can be in any of X states, each state reacting differently to its environment [adding/not adding ones in adding], in some cases moving to a different state when appropriate. Can be a useful model for some brain functions, but since it's (very) finite, it's not powerful enough for all algorithms.

Finland: [#NRC160413] Finnish teachers give have about 20% fewer lesson hours per week, time they can use to work on their lessons. Also, Finnish teachers earn as much or even more than the average Finnish highly educated person. [#Geowissen2009] In 2008, 6500 candidates competed for 800 places in the teacher training. [#Solving the puzzle of why Finns have the highest IQ, but one of the lowest number of Nobel prizes in Europe] Finns have high C + Agreeableness (and also highest average IQ but smallest SD)

First idea: [#Syed46] The first move that chess grandmasters consider is also often the best move {EW: in science though that may be wrong, as intuition and pattern recognition is not optimal for novel situations}

First impression: [#Watt159] Our first impression of something based on limited data “he killed a dog” may lead to many premature conclusions unless we know more about the circumstances. Also consider the many different consequences of say an invention! [#Medi116] The introduction to a subject has a disproportionate influence on your retrieval later as it lays down the initial structure of the event, so it'd better be compelling!

Firstborn: [#Simo133] Birth order is important; over half of notable scientists and other creative/eminent persons are firstborn, eldest sons, eldest when older sibling died or was more than five years older. Creative writers and political revolutionaries are however more likely to be laterborn.

Fischer, Edmond: [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368_supp/full/478S5a.html] Says that the main thing has changed in his career is a more structured approach of problems. Born in China, school in Switzerland, postdoc in USA.

Fischer, Emile: [#Jaffe150] Went to become a chemist despite his father's wishes to work in his wood trading center. [so either enthusiastic and/or disagreeable]

Fit: [#Flourish218] Fat and fitness both influence mortaility, but fitness dominates: fat people who are fit have a low chance of death. [#NS091113] Students in top 5% of fitness rankings score 36 percentile points higher on standarized academic test than those in the bottom 5%.

Fitting: [#EW] In some cases, experiences and personality conflicts in the past have been so strong, that novel situations which are not that similar are translated into that old situation and evoke that reaction; and with some (bad?) luck the edges of the 'hole' erode, and cause even more situations to all evoke that feeling {EW: me and Y}. [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczT-GYJ9wY&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=6] Is desire, like sex?

Five factor model: [#EW/http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/neubert.html] Neuroticim correlates negatively with performance in the workplace, conscientousness and agreeableness help with job performance in social jobs, conscientousness and extraversion help leadership, neuroticism and agreeableness hurt it. Extraversion is correlated to higher job satifaction as are agreeableness and conscientousness, neuroticism negatively correlated, openness doesn't make a difference. Extraversion is related to a thinner area in the cortex that performs social and other inhibition, neuroticism to a thinning in another area.

Five minute list: [ http://www.intermediair.nl/carriere/werk-en-leven/gezondheid-stress-burnout/ben-jij-al-verliefd-op-je-werk?utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=wk12&utm_campaign=traffic ] Make a list of tasks you can finish within 5 minutes (would that make you feel good?)

Fixed action programme: [#Grin107] First of nine learning programmes; is evoked by a specific stimulus, unmodifyable once begun, and is often species-specific. Are especially strongly evoked by superstimuli (like totally red beaks in gulls, or big breasts).

Fixed mindset: [#Dwec6] Having a fixed mindset (believing in fixed intelligence and personality) drives one to prove oneself over and over {EW: but Dweck also says that fixed mindset people tend to avoid challenges!}. Makes people supersensitive of being wrong or making mistakes {Daan?} The fixed mindset discourages people from learning or taking courses. Want partners who adore them, not criticize them. Do not enjoy things they're not immediately good at. {Centrum Autisme} Tend to blame others, everyone but themselves. [#Syed129] Also induces people to lie about their performance (growth mindset doesn't). [#Syed132] Fixed mindset-people do not admit or remedy mistakes, live in psychological world where they do not dare to fail in public. [

Fixity: [#Ster67] The state of having some assumptions about a problem that hamper solving it, even if counteracting instructions are given later (for example the nine-dots problem).

Flannery, Sarah: [#Syed68] Mathematically great girl, father was lecturer in mathematics and would write problems on the blackboard, mathematics also being dinner-table conversations.

Flashbulb memories: [#Kluw52] Flashbulb memories (what were you doing when the planes crashed into the WTC) seem stronger than normal memories, but the details are sensitive to deterioration and alteration, even though the subjects are quite certain that things happened exactly that way!

Fleetwood (Mick): [#Robi39] Mick Fleetwood was a bad and {therefore?} drifting student, but started drumming and got his revelation when he and his sister visited a jazz club in London, after which he became very serious, and developed a burning ambition to go to London and play in a jazz club {belonging?}. Parents supported him going from school early, though (and father had taken up own career/calling as writer).

Flexibility: [#EricB499] (Dance) experts abandon their normal learning strategies when confronted with simple cases. [#White35] Sometimes, being patient is not as effective as trying other strategies to get what you want. [#Isaacson357] It can be good sometimes to be flexible and drop previous appointments (if not: see Kildahl)

Flight: [#Burkem56] If you flee something, it may come back to bite you (?EW: because the challenge will also occur elsewhere in your life?)

Flipped classroom: [#NS080912] Flipping the classroom (Clintondale Highschool, Greg Green) led to reduction in classroom failure, fewer discipline problems, and increases in college entrance and standardized test scores. [VivekGoel opening academical year Leiden 2014]: almost no low grades after flipped classroom – flipping especially helps mediocre/bad students.

Flirting: [#EW] Would skill in flirting be useful for teachers, for flirting is making people feel better about something.

Florence: [#Weiner102] Money was there first (bankers, cloth trade). Did the De Medici invest in art due to fear of hell?

Florence-effect: [#EW/Ster180] 15th century Florence had blossoming arts, since that was considered important, and was even stimulated consciously by those in power. In the States, basketball is scouted vigorously, in Iceland, chess. Every culture makes some 'cultural organisms' more or less likely to blossom.

Flow: [#Colv189] Csikszentmihalyi's theory is that performing at a certain level induces flow, and the more people practice, the higher the level at which they need to perform to experience flow. Problem: much of the deliberate practice isn't fun, at least not for musicians (might be for sportsmen or scientists though). [#Robi96] You lose all sense of time, and feel free and authentic, and it is as if you are just given the ideas, that you don't have to labour for them. {EW: betekent flow dat je niet moet worstelen tegen allerlei andere gedachten, zoals wat je vanavond eet?}. Having clear goals and feedback. [#EricB395] Believing that a (writing) task is intrinsically important helps flow (though pay and other extrinsic motivators may also help – even though those may diminish creativity?) [#Csik14] Feedback should be immediate and unambiguous. {EW: perhaps flow requires the right complexity -things that are too simple (or boring) don't occupy all one's attention, letting everyday worries creep in. Things that are too complex may be confusing and produce anxiety, producing double consciousness again} <+clarity, lack of distraction, not boring, more involving> [#Csik210] Whether students feel skillful, un-selfconscious, cheerful, strong, excited, open, wish-to-be-doing and successful (living up to other's expectations for teacher scores) determines quite a bit of their continued dedication to a talent area. [#Csik214] 9% of young scientists, 17% of mathematicians, 62% of artists, 68% of musicians, and 74% of athletes experienced flow. Flow is however the best predictor by far for achievement. {EW/Csik253 would flow be somewhat addictive, making people strive to repeat the flow experience?} [#Strien27] May be slightly addictive, stimulating musicians, dancers and scientists to strive for more, part of their motivation.

Fluctuating selection: [#Nett64] Not eliminating a specific allele from the genepool since it can be advantageous in some situations and those situations occur often enough to keep it intact. A variant is negative frequency dependent selection, where an allele can survive because it causes rare behaviour which is useful as long as it is rare (like psychopathy).

Fluency: [#Gold145] The easier it is to experience something/imagine yourself doing something, the more likely it is that you will think the option good. For example, ads asking you to name 10 reasons to choose their product are less convincing than those that ask for one reason only, and ads that make it easy to imagine using the product will also increase sales. Having pronounceable names or good handwriting also helps. The easier something goes in, the more likely it is to be appreciated. [#Nati3] Fluency in learning languages seems to mean that there needs to be sufficient time for 'processing' every word before the next word is begun, else the next syllables interfere, the word is not isolated mentally. Can probably be practiced by having a slow speed first, and then slowly increasing it. [ideal for computer software-making mixed-up sentences of a standard vocabulary, and then progressively pronouncing them faster. [#Adams108] Writing down ideas, especially when a time limit is involved, can make people more creative.

Flunking: [#NRC150413] 37% of HBO students and 28% of university students drops out in their first year. [#NRC150910] Drop-out rates are much lower in other countries: partially because stricter demands of access of study (grades) as well as progress/exams (keep up or get out), as well as more intensive contact between students and teachers <Alexander Asting, Harold Bok>.

Flynn effect: [#NS230814Stalled] The IQ scores of the lowest-scoring group have been rising, the scores of the highest-scoring group barely budged; effects due to better education and nutrition are likely.

Focus: [#Gall86] Asking people to focus on the seams of the ball seems to help, at least for a while. Saying 'bounce-hit' also works. Listening at the sounds of tennis balls hitting the racket is also useful. Or the feeling where the racket head is. Maintaining focus between points is hardest, distractions can crowd in. Perhaps concentrate on breathing. [#http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/04/12/how-to-focus/] Focusing by ignoring distracting thoughts (letting them go, as in meditation) ? Eliminate distractions from your environment, and set a time limit.

Focus group: [#StolB60] A focus group is a way of getting input from people and motivates them if their input is later applied.

Fogg model: [#Hooked62] Three requirements for behaviour: you need enough motivation, the ability to do the action, and a trigger must be present.

Follow-through: [#Strien137] Often a discovery (like the dancing frog legs) is not sufficiently explained by the discoverer, and others can really see the causes and consequences. Sometimes the observation is of a relative or complete layperson (nurse sunlight, farmer's girl cow pocks)

Follow-up: [#Whit14] Follow-up is essential if the lessons of training are to stick.

FOMO: [#Hooked57] fear of missing out.

Fonts: [#NS221212] Fonts influence how fast people read something; but harder fonts make people remember things better and to disregard irrelevant information [?takes more thought and attention?]. Though exercise instructions in a hard-to-read-script also makes the exercise itself feel more difficult. Perhaps because if we stumble over a word, we activate the dorsal parietal cortex, for the letter-by-letter-reading mechanism. This area is also linked with attention and memory.

Food: [# http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201011/black-friday-shopping-how-stores-use-psychology-fill-your-cart] high-fat, high-sugar foods shift the brain into a state that makes you more likely to take financial risks and seek instant gratification [#NS280505] For optimal brain performance, breakfast is important, protein rich breakfast with fibres (beans on toast, for example). Toast with marmite may also work (B vitamins are good!) Lunch: omelette and salad (choline and antioxidants). Yogurt (tyrosine). Strawberries and blueberries are also nice... 3x coffee a day may be good to prevent cognitive declime (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16929246?dopt=AbstractPlus)

Food for thought: [#Chem04, Andy Hor] Giving students a frustrating question without clear answer. Teaching tool.

Fooling yourself: [#EricB308] The expert scaters estimated they'd do 20 triple jumps in a session; in reality, they only did six. Apparently, they did not count their actual performance (coach may help here). Or they could not sustain concentration so long...

Fools: [#Greene163] Fools are people who disregard the rule that if it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long-term results, and getting the work done in as efficient and creative manner as possible. Fools focus on immediate money and attention and short-term results. More interested in career or position than in truth. Get worked up about things that are not really important while ignoring problems that will spell doom in the long term. Note: all of us have foolish sides.

Foot-in-door: [#Denktank] Asking people for limited investment (being a teacher for two years) motivates them much more than asking for a large one (staying a teacher all your life)

Forbidden fruits: [#Pers133] The inverse of becoming less interested in a task as the reward increases – things that you have to pay for seem to increase intrinsic motivation.

Forcing novelty: [#Weiner229] Beethoven tried to avoid imitating Mozart, which forced him to explore new alleys.

Foreign country: [#NS] People who have lived in another country for a while become more creative. {Part of the Kai riddle? Darwin also took an extensive trip to get more impressions} [#Greene176] If we visit a foreign country, we can't rely on the familiar anymore and are struck by the oddness and newness of everything we encounter. [#C2W081113] Foreign experience is not only praised because scientists can learn more by living in a totally different country, but also because it would prove that a scientist can function well in different contexts. Though some committees like it because it is an objective fact for which they don't need much expertise or debate to establish.

Foresight: [#Strien171/EW] Many young (and older) scientists may not want to change methods since they worked so far (Peter's principle).

Forgetting: [#Medi100] Most of the forgetting takes place in the first few hours after learning something. [#EW] Memory that would save everything literally would not survive natural selection; we must deduce rules without being confused by details; getting rid of those deleterious details simply has the side effect of forgetting stuff.[#NS270216PlantsForgetStressOnPurpose] Many plants 'forget' stressors after a while. While it is beneficial to be primed against another occurrence of the stressor (drought, for example), it comes with a cost in needless gene expression which needs to be balanced against the benefit.

Formal discipline transfer model: [#Clar242] The idea that training in a generic discipline, such as creative thinking, latin, learning LOGO or outdoor leadership courses will transfer to improved performance on a variety of jobs. Unfortunately, it does not work.

Formal education: [#Ster243] Whole creativity may seem to diminish with more formal education, it is also possible that formal education and knowledge are independent.

Forums: [#EricB624] Professional forums may help tacit knowledge spread.

Framing effect: [#NS050507] The effect that putting something in terms of loss stimulates/impressed people more than putting something in terms of gain. [#SellHuman139] The 'blemished frame' technique: mentioning an irrelevant negative point makes people more likely to buy {other positive properties seem more positive? Or simply because seen as more honest?} But only works if people are in low-effort state and negative information follows the positive information. [#Nass196] Asking people to consider or analyze activates the central route, stressing feelings, emotions, intuition activates the peripheral route of information processing. [#Hooked87] General term of (irrelevant) environmental triggers guiding is to valuing or not valuing something, like violist in subway.

Franklin, Benjamin: [#Franiii] Franklin had lots of self-discipline, as well as practical wisdom. Had fight with his brother; so not very easy, accommodating character, at least when young? Was in any case often disappointed in people, false promises, useless freeloaders, so had lots of adversity. 'Cost me nothing to be civil to inferiors, a great deal to be submissive to superiors'. Franklin himself saw some errors he made in his life, but still quite content overall. Uncle was encouraged in learning by important man in the parish, and became an influential scrivener instead of a smith. Father fled to USA because of religious prosecution in England (since his friends went as well). Ben was youngest, eager reader and learner, did very well at school but father for financial reasons (and not trusting anyone being able to make a living as a scholar) put him to arithmetic school of George Brownell, famous then for his successes and mild, encouraging methods. Failed in the arithmetic though, and was taken home by father again to be raised as candle-maker, father's assumed profession as dyer was in little demand. Loved the water and swimming, and was generally a leader of the boys. Once with his comrades made a little wharf out of stones taken from a building site, but father corrected him, no work was good that was not honest {EW: character!} Father was mechanically adept, fairly musical, but also consulted by people for his wisdom. Liked to have friends at the table, and converse on something useful and instructive in front of the children. Benjamin disliked the trade {so not a very obedient child} and father, afraid Benjamin would elope to sea like another son, showed him all possible other occupations. Benjamin remained fond of reading, invested all his money in books. Was sent to apprenticed to brother who was printer; Franklin borrowed and returned books from fellow-apprentices. Caught eye of tradesman who let him borrow books from his library, and started to compose poetry (with encouragement of his brother), but father dissuaded Benjamin as to the bleak financial prospects of poetry. Was quite disputatious as a youngster (perhaps influence of father's books on religious disputation?) Father saw dispute in writing with friend, and told Ben that his friend was superior in the elegance of his writing. Ambitious to become a good writer, Ben tried to imitate the style of the spectator by transforming the text to hints, and back again a few days later, and invented some other methods for practice. Was encouraged by book of Tryon to become a vegetarian, which turned out to save him money and time. Was influenced by other books, like Socrates, and tried to imitate him (by drawing people into 'humble' verbal combat) but dropped that style after some years, only retained 'modest diffidence'. Also learned arithmetic now easily from a book. Brother started a newspaper, authors visited the shop, and Ben managed to sneak in his own pieces as anonymous and found that the regular 'authors' approved. Conflicts between his brother and Ben, jealousy for Ben's quality? Newspaper continued under Ben's leadership as James was forbidden it by the judges; Ben left prematurely though since he still resented his treatment by his brother. Smuggled himself with help of a friend and selling some books to New York, where other printer was, but who pointed him to his son in Philadelphia. Met atheist doctor/innkeeper on the way who liked the boy for his reading, and kept acquaintance. Asked advice of old woman whom he bought gingerbread from when he understood no boats would go for a few days (asking locals!). In Philadelphia, asked young quaker with good countenance where he could stay, and he pointed him to a good hotel. Son didn't have any work, but pointed him to competitor Keimer. Ben knew much more about printing than his boss (or his competitor), and soon made acquaintance of other read young people; and saved some money through industry and frugality.Returned to parents in Boston, governor offering to set him up in the printing business. Parents still stern, found him too young, but would support him at age 21. On ship befriended old Quaker matron by doing some little services for her, but she warned him against two young women he got along well with; and indeed those were thieves. Old friend had taken to drinking, and at Ben's expense, so relationship soured until he found a captain to bring him to the West Indies. Breaking on the money of Vernon which he should receive and keep was one of first big errata in Franklin's life. Governor was however not the type to keep promises {politician?} and Franklin had not learned about his character yet. Made friends with other young men who liked to read and write, young clerks, though only one of hard-working character. Governor kept postponing sending letters of credit, and Franklin, though bemused, went on with the voyage. Made new friends on the ship. Note that the governor was quite competent except in his tendency to give empty promises. Ralph couldn't find any work, and induced Ben to give him money, and took him to plays so no money was saved. Made acquaintance with bookseller, allowed to borrow second-hand books. Found out that deliberately breaking rules by not paying beer-money, though his boss approved, made his life impossible with his colleagues, so he relented. Constant attendance and great speed recommended him to his master. His friend made onboard, Mr Denham, persuaded to return to Philadelphia with him, as his clerk. Though should be noted that Franklin easily struck up friendships with those of wealth and connections. In the US, Mr Denham died, and Keimer hired Frankllin again, this time to teach his new crew to work effectively. When that had passed, Keimer sought ways to get rid of expensive Ben, and succeeded by scolding him in public. Welshman offered to help him set up after Keimer's inevitable bankrupcy. Returned to Keimer when Keimer asked his help with a big job, and made some friends with those who surveyed the printing process, being better-read and better-socialized than his boss. Was first a freethinker, though honored truth, sincerity and integrity. Note that Ben learned to consider sin bad because it has bad effects on us. Got his first printing job via an acquaintance. Also formed a club of mutual improvement, the Junto. On politics, morals and natural philosophy. All direct contradictions were slightly fined! In his own business was shrewd enough to not only be industrious, but also to appear industrious. Also saw opportunity for much better newspaper than there was at that moment in Philadelphia. Was good in PR, printed a better-looking version of a speech for the House, sending it to every member. Meredith's father could not raise all money, but two of Ben's Junta-friends helped him out financially. Later pamphletted about the need for more paper money, and his pamphlets convinced people (and he got the order). Lost his boarders because he desired bridal money for marrying a relationship of theirs, then married his old love, Miss Read. Found out that people were more willing to subscribe if you tell them that it is an idea of a group of friends, instead of your own {Franklin explains this because of people fearing you getting of higher status; though it's also possible that being 'on a bandwagon' helps} Spent two hours each day reading. Father had told him that a man diligent in his calling would stand before kings. Found sermons of his official church too dry and not related to regular life. Then made a list of 13 virtues, temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity and humility [64-65] Saw his services to others as payment for God's goodness to him. Had a very good memory as well. Never created his planned book on the art of virtue, since he let things interfere. Also wanted to create a party of moral people who dedicated themselves to the good of the country, but never got round to it because he had to take care of his own affairs first {EW: irony...}. Did however try spread his morals in Poor Richard's Almanac and his newspaper. Taught himself French, Italian and Spanish, Italian despite not liking to spend too much time on chess, but letting the winner set a language challenge for the loser. Found learning latin afterwards much easier, recommends first learning french and italian, even if you don't learn latin, you will have acquired some useful knowledge. Junto branched out. Was smart enough to befriend his opposition in the House by asking to borrow a book. Via Junto made some changes in law-keeping (professional watchmen) and fire-fighting. Noted that a great itinerant preacher could be heard over large distances, speeches improved with practice, but since he wrote down his ideas, was very much criticized, and made less lasting influence than a non-writer like Christ or Buddha. Let his apprentices settle in other places, making very good contracts such that they always ended amicably. Made initiatives for college and for militia, second of which succeeded very well. Also organized lottery for financing the battery. Found out that most Quakers did not really oppose defensive war, but were afraid to be cast out by their friends if they said so openly. (some remarks of Franklin on the trouble of having written articles of faith, since they can't be repealed in different circumstances). Also invented a new type of iron stove, did not patent it. Became trustee of both academy and religion hall, had more leisure since entered into a partnership with a former employee that Franklin be paid part of the profits. Got many leadership positions, often used cunning, such as in proposing a law in which the state only gave money if the people contributed so much. Used test case/example to show that street pavement worked. Often wrote in the papers on a subject before trying to pass a law. Developed a plan for a unity of colonies for better defense, but was rejected, BF thought that most people who govern have no time on their hands to do projects to which they are not forced. On hearing the British officers complain on lack of supplies, did not say anything but took care of giving them surprise packages. Got into electricity since he met a Dr. Spence who performed some of those experiments [EW: well, Franklin knew everyone...] His first experiments were not very highly thought at at the Royal Society, and people laughed about his suggestion that lightning was electricity. But acquaintance encouraged Franklin to publish it. Also met general paralyzed with indecision. More capable general didn't like to command 'finds low seat the easiest'. When sailing, wondered about all captains following their own set of rules, and whether experimentation would not find the best course. Waited for year on answer of proprietaries, but they proved amenable when their case came out into the open, in the King's court. Keeping things 'under wraps' apparently never works when people would act against their own intest by acting. [#Greene130] Practiced himself to not get emotional in interacting with people, cutting his own insecurities and desires from the equation; helped him to melt their resistance or thwart their malevolent plans. Applied this with great effect on Kreimer, a prickly gentleman who was 'too friendly' – turned the tables on Kreimer's plan by making contacts with all important customers and connect with seuccessful merchants in the area, taught himself new skills like engraving and ink-making. Franklin thought about how other people were experiencing the world, what they were feeling and missing. [#266] Continued learning as he aged, became almost prescient when he reached his eighties.

Franklin, Rosalind: [#Hargit238] Had very different personality from Wilkins, and the two did not get on. [#NS140412] (book Jenifer Glyn), Franklin's hates were as enduring as her friendships, and she tended to fall out with lots of people.

Fraud: [#NRC111210] China is rich with all kinds of fraud and bribery, especially at universities. {EW: why?} [#NS171112] Shimin Fang explains it from a combination of totalitarianism, lack of freedom of speech, press and academic research, extreme capitalism that tries to commercialize everything including science and education, traditional culture, the lack of scientific spirit, culture of saving face and so on. Also no credible channel to publish allegations, or ways to investigate and punish academic misconduct. [#NRC121013] Fraud in science may be a combination of overmuch ambition (not fear of job loss) and lack of transparency/checks in science.

Free: [#McGon117] Next to food, one thing that sets your brain into dopamine-rich, reward-seeking mode. Similarly, when you are in a reward-seeking mode, you don't only seek out indulgent food, but also items that are on sale! [but only of things that typically activate the reward system, not oatmeal or laundry detergent]

Free spaces: [#Switch246] Small-scale meetings where reformers can gather and ready themselves for action without being observed by the conservative majority.

Free time: [#NS21042012] Due to cooking, humans only need to spend about one hour per day chewing, chimps need 6. So perhaps more free time to develop culture, and more energy for energy-hungry brains?

Freedman: Robert Marc: author, did Nobel prize investigation.

Freedom: [#PaulW] Giving students too little freedom, or too many, frustrates their happiness/learning. [#Schmid227] 20% time at Google does not mean a regular day off. People can get their time whenever they want. Kind of protection against overly imperious managers. Also note that it is ‘public’; people can recruit others to help on their project. Like build a prototype to help that. And freedom also builds skills that may come in useful later. Demo days also work.

Freeloaders: Would speech and brains have evolved to detect/disseminate information about freeloaders? {based on #Grin143}?

Freenoting: [#Weng46] Writing down everything that comes to mind as fast as you can (10-20 pages, or 10-20 minutes by tape recorder. Can also be done during lectures, you'll learn a lot more about the subject.

Frenemies: [#NS240514] Relationships with 'frenemies' (people who bring us down but whom we put up with) can actually damage our health, as interacting with them is stressful.

Fridge: [#Jaff27] Even politics (as well as the university) has a 'fridge' for ideas, that may be promising, but neither seem urgent, important or convincing enough to try at once {EW: like my talent workshop?}

Friends: [#Robi144] According to Judith Rich Harris, one's friends in youth are much more important for character formation than ones parents. The danger is that friends can punish you for having interests outside of the group norms of coolness. [#EW] Or do people try find like-minded friends? [#EricB564] Exceptional calculators had the numbers as their friends and actively seek closer acquaintance with them {EW: as had I with the elements}. [#Burn194] Asking friends how they would think in a situation you have problems with can help you acquire more productive beliefs. [#NS270310] You are not influenced by people who you don't consider a friend, though they may consider you a friend. [#59sec86] Being accompanied, or even thinking about a friend makes an obstacle such as a hill seem less difficult. [#NS240514] Interestingly, were are genetically more similar to our friends than to random strangers, we're about as related as fourth-degree cousins. [#NS240514FriendsWithBenefits] According to Dunbar, you need contact with your closest friends every other day, with next 5 closest pals once a week; once a month for next 15, next 50 once every 6 months; rest of 150 about once a year. Most important criteria for friendship are similar language, profssion, worldview (political, moral and religious), sense of humour, local identity, and education. Personality less important that cultural preferences (same muysic)

Frontal lobe activation: [#Ster148] Creative people have lesser frontal lobe activation during creative tasks than non-creative persons.

Frontotemporal dementia: [#Imagine106] People get worse in memory and impulse control, but have insatiable need to create (can even achieve some artistic success if their disease doesn't kill them first).

Fructose: [#NS090515] “Honey trumps money”- fructose makes our brains more sensitive to food rewards than glucose does, even making people prefer food over money prizes.

Fruit-law: [#EW/IntelliMagic] One can recognize the tree by its fruits, an environment by the people in it.

Fruitful: [#Hargit83] “It is more important for an idea to be fruitful than it is to be correct”. Sometimes you take the right step for the wrong reason (this is science). Besides, it's really hard to reconstruct how you made a discovery in the first place.

Frustration: [#Franzen210] The greater the expectancy that a goal will be achieved, the greater the frustration if it isn't. [#Greene199] Being able to endure periods of staleness and frustration may be necessary for each great creative work, to finally 'force' the breakthrough [EW: hmmm... only works if motivation remains high]. [#Nass149] You can 'handle' frustration by noticing it : 'It sounds like you are frustrated with...”, asking feedback on correctness “is my impressio of your feelings about right?” and sympathy (that must feel lousy). Perhaps also taking responsibility (for Xs part)

FUDGE: [#Internet] Factors that determine whether a word will become part of a language, Frequency, Unobtrusiveness (easy to remember), Diversity of uses and situations, Generation of alternative terms, Endurance of the concept

Fuller, Buckminster: [#Greene41] Invented things as a child, was very bright, admitted to Harvard, but did not feel at home at strict atmosphere there. Started skipping classes, drinking, and leading a bohemian lifestyle.When he wanted to kill himself after yet another financial debacle, heard a voice “You do not belong to yourself- you belong to the universe. You may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others” Whenever he thought of money first, disaster followed.

Fun: [#EWL] A fun task may take less willpower to perform. May be a fun/difficulty dimension matrix? Like importance, may naturally reinforce the attention you give to a task, lessening the need for willpower to continue focusing on it. [#EricB561] Gamm started calendrical calculations for fun, and then entered for a TV competition... [#EW] Deliberate practice also works if it isn't fun, but may not work well when the person doesn't consider it important (McEnroe?) [#Carn68] People rarely succeed in anything unless they have fun doing it, but beware when the fun becomes work {EW: thinking about it incessantly?} [#EW] Fun does not by itself lead to success. Eric at LUMC, or even Leonardo da Vinci who needed some guardians to finish what he started.

Function: [#Laird126] Some objects we can recognize by deducing their function. Interestingly, the function-determining and 3D-shape-determining parts of the brain work independently.

Function fluctuation: [#EricB588] How your behavioral traits change over shorter time periods; If you are more intelligent/alert in the morning than in the evening, or vice versa.

Functional fixedness: [#EricB27] Being a greater expert in an area will increase the chance that you strongly activate one set of nodes/explanations which blocks out alternatives which may be correct ('if all you have is a hammer...').

Functional stupidity: [#NS300313] Large organisations are often rife with 'functional stupidity': there is no direct relationship between what they do and the outcome, so they had no way to judge the consequences of their actions. Ambiguity is rife, so was avoided at all costs. It's no-ones' problem to raise concerns, and if someone did, they were disciplined for seeming to undermine those with greater authority.

Fundamental attributional error: [#EW] People generally attribute behaviour to character, not circumstance, even though this is usually wrong. Similarly, people generally attribute performance [such as talent] to nature, not nurture, to genes, not through exceptional circumstances, though this is generally wrong as well. Yet the latter error determines much of the underpinnings of our school system {EW: IQ-tests novel situations}. [#Sommers35] Our false confidence that we can predict the behaviour of others may be reassuring. Helps us see the world as a stable place and see ourselves in a positive light.

Future: [#Csik212] believing that one's talent area is important to one's future is an important predictor for continued involvement.

Future self: [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvU44vB8X7E&feature=autoplay&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&lf=autoplay&playnext=2] We tend to see our future self as a stranger with much more willpower and free time, and not saving money; introducing ourselves to our future self may help. Also, because we don't feel the frustrations, fears and cravings of a stranger half as much as our own. [#McGon96] Remedy: see a choice as a commitment to doing the same thing day after day for a week, a month a year, and see if you like the consequences. [#NS220417TheGoodDelusion] For changing behaviour it may help if you think of your future self, or yourself 10 years down the line.

Gagne: [#Medsker214] Five categories of learning: intellectual skills, verbal information, attitudes, motor skills, and cognitive strategies.

Galileo: [#Crop5] Galileo had little regard for authority, and a confrontational, witty, ironic and sarcastic confrontational style. {EW: like Daan?} Was a bit of sycophant to the nobles (though that was just common survival strategy at that time, though he was very good at it as well} Loved fame and influence more than money. Was gregarious and witty, but also tended to paranoia. Was ill often (really ill? Or depressed?). Was often provoked enough/passionate enough to enter debates.

Gallant, Tristan: Loves anime. Had made many anime music videos (so much experience in video editing). Won a prize for one of them. Started reviewing anime. Social introvert (not good in small talk), but likes/needs attention and approval. Elated when first review got 50 views, but did not do anything for three months after second review bombed (went for 'easy laughs' with bad anime OVA – but noone had heard of it). But after a few months considered camera waste of money otherwise, and was strategic enough to review something more recent, what people were interested in watching. “What if they didn't like me?” Used tutorials to learn to use visual effects in his show. 'Lovingly borrowed' all the stuff he found cool.

Game: [#Gall105] People also play 'games', they have ulterior motives guiding their actions.

Game theory: [#EW] Combines with tragedy of commons: everyone prefers a working toilet, less preferred is a non-working toilet, but even less preferred is having a toilet that you repaired but others did not contribute to!

Gaming: [#EW/Erfworld] Jack and Parson 'gamed', running impossible scenarios so they would be better prepared for unexpected scenarios. Would that really help?

Gap theory: [#EW/Heath] Good teachers create 'gaps' in knowledge, make students feel that something is unknown, making them curious. Is only possible if a student has enough surrounding knowledge to perceive a gap in the first place, instead of a gigantic meaningless void. [#Will33] Writers don't say everything; giving too few gaps bores the readers, too many gaps puzzles them.

Gap year: [#DanielleVogels,NRC220613] There is less study-dropout among first years after a gap year than among students who directly come from high school (18% vs 26%), in HBO that only goes for those students that have worked in their gap year (25% vs 31%) [EW: on univ students: perhaps being older helps, or populations are disparate (would women have gap year more often?, or from richer families]

GAPP: [#WebsiteNemo] European research consortium dedicated to investigating the choice of career in science and gender gaps therein, though it looks they are doing it by interviews (what people THINK is important) rather than by more experimental research.

Garcia effect: [#Flourish230] Rats can't learn all stimulus-response combinations: sound and nausea, or taste and electric shock not.

Gates, Bill: [#Isaacson,328] Was a biut of a chameleon/sociopath: gave three totally different personality profiles (mathematician, computer engineer, politician) in his application letters to universities. But also was a pain in the ass – he put people down when it was not necessary. Collaborated with Allen (who had very broad interests – proferred ideas, Gates selected them) and with a math student in their dorm who had developed floating point routines. Gates also took risks (also in car driving). [357] Could be cool externally, while internally wracked by doubts. [315] Was extremely stubborn, also perfectionist in some regards (practiced leap from thrash can until it was perfect) Did not have strong social skills in primary school (so parents sent him to private school). Was a 'serial obsessor' (in contrast to Allen, who had many interests). Had clear ambition for money (declared in high school that he would be worth 1 (10?) million at age 30?) Was extremely driven and competitive. Note that closest friend died when Gates was 16-17.

Gateway drug: [#NS07032015SentinelAtTheGatesOfAddiction] Smoking (nicotine) enlarges the chance that you get addicted to cocaine, as nicotine enhances the expression of FosB, which makes the brain more receptive to rewards.

Gay-Lussac: [#Jaffe130] Worked together with Alexander von Humboldt (to discover whole ratios of gases combining?)

Gc: [#Eric32] Gc, crystallized intelligence, is very culture specific and based on general knowledge and problem-solving skills. [EricB593] Does not decline with age, may even improve. Note that Gc only measures 'basic' knowledge; it vastly underestimates the particular capabilities of experts.

Geim, Andre: [#NS211213] In 1996, day job was tease out properties of superconductors, but itched to investigate a more basic question: can you make water magnetic? “Sometimes, if something has not been done before, you have to do somethin:, Late friday night poured water into the electromagnet. 2002 another Friday-night experiment led to Graphene. “It was garage tinkering, but garage tinkering by someone who after his garage has a highly equipped lab”

Gell-mann, Murray: [#Crop403] Father, Arthur Gellmann (born Isidore) was distinguished looking man whose intellectual ambitions were never realized, as had to abandon his studies early to help his parents out. Had very good mind, very good at languages, but pedantic, overbearing teacher. Man in love with learning and with the sound of his own voice; not a great teacher. Language school did not survive Depression, and Arthur withdrew from family to study relativity, mother denied troubles by being pathologically cheerful. Murray educated himself together with his smart brother Ben by visiting museums and the park (love for ornithology); was also a prodigy, great at arithmetic and spelling piano teacher got him into private school on scholarship. This opened the doors to Yale, Murray wanted archaeology (father said he'd starve), father insisted on engineering, settled on physics. At Yale, Gell-mann was impressed by Henry Margenau, physicist and science philosopher. However, developed writer's block; both because he didn't know the formalities of writing a paper, and because his father's disapproval loomed large over him. Also block at graduate studies, but prod from Oppenheimer who had offered him a job contingent on completion of the dissertation made him finish in a few days. Gell-mann had great ability to look beyond the immediate details of a problem, and reveal the underlying patterns {novice-expert difference?} Then went to Fermi's institute (part because Oppenheimer couldn't offer a faculty position), also with the help of one of his MIT friends. Fermi's institute was 'the place to be' at that time in physics. Fermi's style appealed to Gell-Mann's, similarities to Weisskopf at MIT. Got married, and it changed him, made him from a sort of malfunctioning computing machine into a person that cared for others {EW: father was also aloofish by nature?} From symmetrical structures, and threefold symmetry, derived quarks. Though needed to add colours to not put close quarks in the same quantum state. Was wiser in sending his quark paper not to the top physics journal than his student was (got rejected). Gell-Mann: genius for theoretical physics, very good at choosing memorable terminology, broad interests from linguistics to ornihology and Chinese cuisine. Also took on many assignments on public service (committees and such). He did have the habit of putting colleagues down, especially those in competition with him; while Feyman and himself used each other as sounding boards, but relationship was/grew difficult. Good lecturer, charming conservationalist, but writer's block. Was temporarily alienated from his son and daughter {inherited difficult character?} [#Hargit56] Liked to classify things as a child.

Gender: [#Eyse94] The creative achievements of males correlate more strongly with measured creativity than those of females. Females are less often recognized as geniuses; this cannot be wholly explained by marriage and children (productivity of married female scientists is not lower than that of their single colleagues). Perhaps it is due to lower creativity due to lower psychopathology, perhaps it is because there are fewer high-IQ females than males (smaller brains makes a (small) difference, as does a narrower Gaussian distribution). Gifted females have stronger social values (and lesser theoretical values) than gifted males. Males were focused more on I, females distributed around IAS. And only 55% of females (to 95% of males) intended to do fulltime work until retirement. [#John104] Boys' stories tend to center more around mastery and achievement, and girls' around feelings and interpersonal relationships. And are females less willing to fight for their new theories or achievements? [#Robi142] Arianna Huffington hypothesized that women are so dependent on approval that they have a much greater fear of failure, and are more risk-avoiding (women often think they have nothing to write when invited) [#EricB563] The greater number of mathematically excellent males seems to come from their greater variation, not from greater average ability (the average girl easily outperforms the average boy in all academic subjects, though only slightly for math). But country/education is much more important for math skill than gender. [#Ster286] Females are more likely to drop out than males (from science careers?) [#Ster313] Despite equal promise, there were no female artists achieving recognition 20 years after a particular art school, while there were some men who did. [#Csik207] Gender did not affect continuation of commitment to a talent area, at least not through highschool years. [#Volkskrant] Boys make friendships in groups, girls on an individual level; girls collaborate when they have no risk of being left in the lurch – boys choose to collaborate or not based on what they estimate gives the better result. Girls look more at faces, boys more at objects. Though 20% of girls behaves 'boyish' and the reverse. [#Hatt56] Gender differences exist, but are usually very small; girls being slightly more agreeable, and more drawn to biological sciences, less to computers. Main difference is that girls have much better effortful and inhibitory control, better able to regulate their attention and inhibit their impulses. [#Intermediair060511] If the first child is a boy, marriage becomes more stable, and the wife more frequently starts to work less (as well increasing the chance to get another child).[#int] Women lose about 20% of their starting salary by being too eager for social approval; they do better when negotiating for other women, however/ [#Franzen57] Males enjoy competition more, and appreciate differences in status more. Self-confidence is similar to chimpanzee bluff, to prevent real fights from breaking out. [#http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/crone-mannelijkevrouwelijkehersenen.pdf] In women, the social part of the brain becomes as active even judging sentences about self as when judging sentences about others; for men, there is a greater difference in activation. If you tell women working in a 'man's world' that especially male characteristics are important, they see no chance to do it well and give up. If you tell them that female characteristics are important, they don't feel threatened, but also are not motivated to change. If you tell her that both are important, they do their best more and perform better. [#Nass171] Even very young children spend most of their time with kids of the same gender. Women tend to show more concern for their listeners and tend to compliment and apologize more. All cultures prescribe markers of gender. Female spokespersons make products seem more feminine, 'male' spokespersons make products seem more masculine. Content also skewed perceived gender of the voice. [#Sommers161] Men are more likely to aggress without provocation, but men and women are equally likely to be physically aggressive in response to insult or direct threat. [#NeuvelWaaromJongens geen meisjes zijn] Boys spend 20 minutes a day less on homework than girls, stronger culture of 'effortless achievement'. May also play a role that boys want to be cool (meaning: different from girls). Without girls in their class to compare themselves with, boys may work harder. Besides, sooner or later boys discover something that they want to be very good at, and their revulsion against hard work makes a 180 degree turn. [#NRC230711] If men are believed that there are fewer women for each men, American men start spending more (even above their means) while Chinese men start saving more. Women are unaffected in spending. [#Strien283] Eminent female scientists almost never have brothers. A problem is also that for girls, the seductive role model is much more attractive than the 'blue stocking', the negative image is much worse than being a nerd is for boys. Of the first females entering academia, the firstborn were also quite open for new theories and such, perhaps because they needed to be rebellious anyway [EW: and not care overmuch of what people thought of them]. Women may have stronger pressure from environment to procreate, but may also feel that need biologically? [#Strien288] Strikingly, often the fathers are more encouraging of a scientific career than the mothers are. [#EosWiseman] Men usually call about their work, women tend to make social calls. [#https://hbr.org/2014/12/rethink-what-you-know-about-high-achieving-women] One factor holding women back may be expectations: men have tendencies to think that their careers take precendence and that the woman will take care of the children, women have as well (though to lesser degrees), but anyway, expectations seem to become reality more often than expected (perhaps because HBS men and women marry different partners). Interestingly, men feel happier when they eclipse their wife career-wise, but wives at the same time feel less happy when eclipsed; for egalitarian relationships the situation is inversed. Women also have problems finding intellectually challenging part-time jobs, and many opt out not because of lack of ambition, but because of lack of growth opportunities [of course, men don't have such an opt-out] [#NS300515] Men tend to use fewer positive emotional cues in their messages than women do. [#IEEEJul16StrategiesForRetainingFemaleEngineers] Women prefer environments which are collaborative rather than hierarchical, and avoid jobs that force them to live in their work. Having more women in higher positions also helps. ]#NS081016MenGetViolentIfWomenAreAplenty] If there are relatively more women than men, men become more promiscuous and hence in conflict with other men, so more crime and rape.

General Electric: [#Colv48] GE wants people who are externally focused, are clear thinkers, have imagination, are inclusive leaders, and are confident experts.

General knowledge: [#Root] The most successful scientists believe that knowledge of art, poetry and music is part of being an educated scientist.

General learning theory: [#Kluw253] General learning theory makes some pretty good predictions on animals in general, but animals seem to escape the rules in particular cases. For example, rats can learn to associate a weird taste with nausea about 12 hours later, while gulls with excellent vision cannot determine the identity of their own eggs. Animals generally learn things more easily that are (evolutionary) useful for them to learn, and have difficulties learning things that would never occur in their natural environment.

Generation effect: [#Wiki] The phenomenon that you remember urangutan better if it is presented to you like ur_n_u_a_. The mechanism of the effect is unclear {EW: perhaps mystery increases attention/activation?} May not work better than imagery, and works better for familiar material than unfamiliar/new material {EW: so may work a bit like humor, where understanding the clue helps the feeling of elation?}

Generations: [#SimonB141] Usually, the number of geniuses in generation g correlates to the number of geniuses in generation g-1, and a bit to those in g-2. Removing those effects makes geniuses randomly distributed over time. So golden ages and such. But also (positive) effects of political fragmentation and revolts against imperial rule. Effects seen after 1-generation delay, so when prospective geniuses are in their youth. Political anarchy (political murders, coups d'etat, capricious executions) have a negative effect (when occurring in generation g-1). Wars only have influence (and a negative one) if they are balance-of-power wars in civilized areas (WWI/WWII Europe). Also, no lingering effects, effects of war last only as long as the wars themselves. For a part because the smartest people channel their creativity into only a few 'useful' products, which may not be what they are really passionate about (or what not really be that important for peace-time)

Generativity: [#Nati70] Words are better remembered as they are used by the learners in different contexts or ways.

Generosity: [#NS131110] People from cultures with more market transactions and with a higher percentage of Christians/IMuslims are more generous towards strangers {EW: consistent with religion is functional-hypothesis} Chance of punishment for unequal distribution goes up with community size (50 no, 5000-10,000 yes!) [#Sommers193] Men buying drinks are considered more attractive afterwards (correlation) and more likely to eventually win a date.

Genes: [#Howe203] Which genes are expressed, 'intelligence genes' or not, depends in complex ways on the other genes and the environment. In addition, genes which, when knocked out, result in lack of intelligence do not necessarily cause intelligence themselves; the 'any fool can knock down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one'-effect. Genes are more 'ingredients for a stew' than blueprints for traits. They encode proteins, not phenotypes. [#HoweArt] If there are genetic effects, they mainly seem to affect/influence untrained performance, correlation after training is much smaller. [#NRC010111] If people hear that obesitas is genetically determined, they eat more cookies, women make tests worse after hearing that men have better maths genes, people judge psychiatric diseases as worse if they can be explained genetically, and discriminate more when another race/group has different genes. As if ones genes are the unchangeable core of our selves. [#NS241211] ACTN3 is good for sprinters or long jumpers; NRF2 for endurance athletes. [#NS210712] One form of angiotensin converting enzyme is better for endurance athletes, another for sprinters. [#NS101113] OR5A1 influences being able to smell violets, important for wine tasting.

Genetics: [#Pink20] Identical twins share startling behavioural similarities, such as sneezing playfully in a crowded elevator, even when raised apart. {EW: this would tie in with genes for disease being kind of multiplicative; greater similarity in genes causes exponentially greater similarity in behaviour (or basically perhaps chaos theory revisited}.

Geniuses: [#Eyse34] Genius is continuous with talent, there is no great leap of distinction between the two categories (and a true separation is therefore also impossible). Seem to have more intellectual and wider interests than a control group, but are especially strong at interest in a single thing and persistence/force of character, and desire to excel. Exceptional industry, meticulousness and perserverance. Powerfully driven by the urge to create. Self-sufficiency, introversion, ego-strength. [#Simo87] Personality is open, with diverse interests, more introverted than extraverted, independent/autonomous (sometimes even rebellious!), persistent, usually appearing workaholics. However, often do various projects at the same time! There is a link between psychopathology and genius, few prominent leaders show psychopathology, however many prominent artists and writers do! Natural scientists are somewhere in between the scale of madness. However, extreme madness is detrimental to creativity, so creators often walk a fine line. Second of all, intelligence and self-discipline set bounds to madness in creators. Some genius seems born (Galton), but some genius seems rather unpromising at first (Darwin) but may surpass the “born genius”. Often geniuses have an enriched home environment (books, stimulating games, visits to museums). However, having lived in several states/countries and having parents with odd hobbies tends to encourage artistic creativity. Too-happy youths are not good however – handicaps and adversity in the home environment help. Surprisingly many geniuses have also lost a parent while young (though politicians show the greatest effect here!) While many smart children do well at school, many geniuses are critical of the tests and coercing facts into children's minds. But in general there does not seem ANY correlation between school achievement and achievement in later life. (Graduating with honors- some geniuses did, some didn't. So what?) And the more education is not better, inverted U-curve – optimum is reached halfway bachelor for most arts, few years in graduate school for scientists. Self-education is however enormously important, being an omnivorous reader is a good sign. Marginality (coming from a different culture) also helps. Intense exposure to two or more languages helps creativity. [[ It can also be argued that those differences stem from nature, as more intelligent parents tend to be older and die “earlier”, intelligent parents have books anyway, and only the strong of will emigrate ]] [#Strien29] Genius is not universal, and cannot take on a subject to make something amazing within a short time; needs lots of labour and time of one's life. [#Strien44] Often people need a hero to workship, if a God is not available, take a movie star or a politician; a scientist can also be called a 'genius' to emphasize his workshop-worthiness. [#SimonB39] In general, the greatest geniuses have the greatest progeny (of ideas), some of which are really outstanding. Simonton also posits that a genius should not imitate itself, but also that a genius has an own style (perhaps because each mathematician had specific preferred tricks and methods). Simonton also defines a broadly valued domain (problem: some domains may seem unimportant backwaters at some times?) and the requirement of acquiring domain-specific expertise [#SimonB97] Both scientific and artistic geniuses tend to be open to experience, introverted, hostile, driven and ambitious. But artists more imaginative, impulsive, norm-doubting, nonconforming, independent, cold, aloof, anxious, and emotionally sensitive. Scientists more flexible, dominant, arrogant, self-confident, and autonomous. [#Weiner75] Does genius have to do with the capacity to be amazed? [#150] Would some geniuses have the desire to change the world, to improve it?

George Bailey-effect: [#Redirect62] You can intensify happiness at something best by not asking them how things came to be, but what would have happened if it had not come to be! (like in 'It's a wonderful life')

Gestures: [#EW270112] Gestures help students learning; would they also help young scientists understanding concepts better?

Getting what you want: [#White12] Getting what you want is a skill than can be learned, for example by stealing ideas from others, by studying them, by imitating them, by taking initiative, and realizing that life is a percentage game and that you can influence 85% or such, and focus on that. And knowing what you want.

Gf: [#EricB32] Gf is 'fluid intelligence', seems to be related to the capacity of working memory. [#EricB593] Declines with age.

Giants, shoulders of: [#EW] Bolzmann used Maxwell's equations, and (or we) also used the Stirling approximation of factorials.

Gibbs, Willard: [#Crop106] Was 'born theorist', general knowledge and intuition generally taught him when he was right. Yet didn't have much contact at all with colleagues. Note that he tended to use geometric-style arguments, which were going out of fashion (but visualizing the surfaces helped understand the meaning of the concepts better than pure analysis could). Great powers of visualization, plane containing the two tangential vectors 'rolling'over the energy surface. Wrote great book (' Equilibrium of heterogenous substances') but published in obscure journal, was too isolated, and his writing style was inaccessible (also because he often did not give intermediate steps in his proofs, so readers may take days or weeks to reconstruct them). Always tried to approach a subject from its greatest simplicity, making it as simple as possible. Did have a huge mailing list to send reprints to about every scientist in the world who could possibly be interested in his work; most went unnoticed, but some struck home (for example with Maxwell). Father was professor in philology, but was very good at it, focused on accurate knowledge and precise statement. Youngest sister died as he was 10, mother's health deteriorated when he was 15. Studied for three years in the scientific centres of Paris, Berlin, Heidelberg. Unpretentious friendly, often humorous, and accommodating (accepted all questions and teaching duties with mildness; not 'asocial') Throughout life had weak health, but good coordination and some athletic ability. Never married. Lectured and wrote without notes (Newton couldn't think without a pen in his hand). Never discussed his researches informally. Isolation in the States might have been to some advantage, because he was not involved in the European controversies about theories. Work was his life, and he enjoyed both.

Gifted: [#EW] Very educating parents can probably increase Gc so much (together with possible early ripening) that they can make young children more 'gifted' than they would be at age 18, when the brain has stopped ripening and the Gc measured by IQ tests has evened out due to sufficient schooling. [#Mehr140] Gifted children in Terman's study were also superior on health, physique, social adjustment and moral attitudes {conforming?} The most successful later in life had higher prudence, self-confidence, perseverance, and desire to excel. Freedom from inferiority feelings too, and coherent/integrated goal-directed behavior. And more common sense! Biggest differences were in drive to achieve and in all-around mental and social adjustment. Higher measures of self-concept, internal control, lower anxiety. More resilient to stress. Less psychopathology. [#Hatt100] Gifted students can receive special lessons, an entire special program, or be promoted one year (acceleration). The latter is most efficient. [#NS091010] Very few gifted children rise to fame and fortune, and they had to work extremely hard for most of their lives to get there. A gifted child only has to be ahead of its peers, a gifted adult has to make a contribution to the world. If parents think a child is gifted while it is not, it is a terrible burden. Best reaction is to be nurturing; worst reaction is parent's need for their child to be gifted. Mothers encourage children more in music and theatre, fathers in sport, mathematics and chess. Gifted children who are not so labeled do much better than 'labeled' gifted children, because 'labeled' children come from families with all sorts of emotional problems. Conversely, most talented adults (scientists or entrepreneurs) were never identified as gifted as children. Important factors for fulfilling the potential: personality, emotional stability, social circumstances, education, not to mention fate and how you deal with it. For the gifted with the capability to work hard and the personality and motivation to see and grab opportunities, the sky is the limit. Acceleration can be bad, especially if you have enormous travel distances, too early specialisation (age 7), or too highly demanding schools leaving no freedom to children to explore. [#Geowissen09] Knut Langhans' physics class does not only have gifted students, as many of those lack in Toleranz and Ausdauer. [#Greene45] Giftedness can be a curse, as you never learn the value of diligence and focus.

Gifted education: [#NRC291112] Gifted education is often seen by school leaders as too expensive, asking too much of the personnel. [#Hargit121] Quite some later Nobel prize winners came from the Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, where there were special classes where gifted children could do two years in one, children fed on each other and on each other's excitement in learning, and did projects which were not in the regular class program., Sophie Wolfe there was not a teacher (stocked materials) but loved the students and started science clubs. Never gave answer to questions but encouraged students to find out for themselves, whether that involved going to the library or doing an experiment. High school teacher of Glenn Seaborg told students about interesting work that was going on, controversies, and the big discoveries that were being made.

Gigs: [#Tonn113] Gigs give very important experience and skills for the beginning artist.

Gilbert model: [#StolB38] Performance can be limited by lack of information, resources, incentives/consequences, knowledge/skills, capacity and motivation. Note that in most cases the environmental factors are to blame, and usually much cheaper and easier to fix than personality factors.

Gingrich, Newt: [#Packer22] Great perseverance (took more than 8 years to break into politics) saw opportunities everywhere (cameras in congress). None of his allies could stand him, Clinton's need for love saw Gingrich's inner insecurities (and his need to be feared) and allowed him to trap Newt.

Giving: [#EW/ElsDas] Sometimes the thing that people want to give is the thing they themselves most want/need/desire.

Global outlook: [#Greene297] Masters always have a more global outlook than 'normal' people, who assign extraordinary significance to the present. Always remind yourself of the purpose of your current work and how it meshes with your long-term goals.

Glosses: [#Nati176] Glosses (marked words with simple explanations in margins) help readers learn more vocabulary from a text, though the overall effect is not too great.

Glucocorticoids: [#WikiYerkesDodson] Intermediate levels of glucocorticoids/stress works best for learning.

Glucose levels: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201004/diet-porn] Seeing sweet or fat foods makes our blood glucose levels drop {EW: to prepare for coming spike or encouragement to eat?} which may reduce willpower.

GMR: [#Ster145] Glucose Metabolic Rate: inversely correlated to intelligence and how well one has learned a problem. Lower GMR may be due to synaptic pruning (lesser synapses)

Goal displacement: [#Ster376] Making rules to achieve one objective the objective in itself, like is happening with CITO-scores. Goal displacement hampers creativity, which tends to break rules to achieve objectives.

Goal setting: [#EricB708] Experts set more specific goals than novices. A combination of outcome goals and process goals works best.

goals: [#NS090917Eight ways to achieve your goals – no willpower required] Make it a money-losing venture; losing money is more painful than not getting it in the first place. Pay yourself a lump sum to begin with, and then fine yourself if you fall short of your goals. 2) use subliminal messages (having reminders of your goal lying around) 3) make abstract goals visual (like making a graph that grows) 4)  language: don't "fight" desires, 'stop' or 'pause' them instead. 5) regular smaller rewards. 6) Near misses are more motivating than wins, competing with someone slightly better than yourself may be best. 7) don't eat much fat, hgh amounts of fat impair the mesolimbic dopamine system, which controls motivation. In breaks, laughing helps.

Goblin philosophy: Gevlon gebruikte addons (zoals quest tracker) om tijd te besparen. Time is money: collaborate on quests, skip quests with relatively little XP for their time (gather X of…), and invest in skills (bags, skills, good weapons/armor)

God: [#Watt39] Would it be helpful to ask God to help you with your studies?

God's hands: [#Pealvii] Putting a project in God's hands can help <EW perhaps diminish your own worrying and focusing on the problem at hand?> “I am in God's hands”

Goethe: [#Jaffe121] Very interested in sciences too, but amateur/dillettante. [#Greene304] Father, lacking success himself, wanted to give Goethe the best possible education. G. may have had some mania or manic depression himself? Developed weird belief system (spirit of nature) and hated conventional life as a lawyer (high O?) Even disliked life of writers (so smug, and so ill-informed about real life). Stopped his attempts to reform the duke and threw himself on his studies instead. In his fifties and sixties he wrote in the morning, did scientific experiments in the afternoon, discussed with friends on aesthetics and politics in the evening. Had courage to deny the audience the encore of Wether.

Golden-chain-effect: [#Ellemers] High salary makes employees want to stay with the company, but does not incite them to work.

Goldsmith: [#EricB293] Researcher of prodigies (most did not have corresponding adult accomplishment).

Good enough: [#EW/Laird84] A fly does not create an internal model of the world, it has automatic mechanisms that are not perfect, but good enough for surviving most things, and cheap enough to compensate for inaccuracies. Good versus cheap; also nature makes that balance. {EW: also for humans; are our brains 'good enough' for most purposes, but inadequate for others?}

Good, fast and cheap, choose two: [#EW] Can also be inverted: you can get things cheaper if they can be slower or lower-quality.

Google-time: [#Medi274] Employees at Google are allowed to spend 20% working on projects they find interesting. The technique works well: 50% of Google products come from this '20%-time'

Gossip: [#HaidtH54] Gossip not only is a useful first form of censoring/revenge, it also helps us navigate the web of social relationships (who likes/hates whom), and we are automatically motivated to share stories (which are mostly about others!) with our friends. Where the reciprocity reflex is kicked in. Gossip is overwhelmingly critical, and focuses on the moral and social violations of others. Only 1/10th is about good deeds. When people tell juicy gossip, they feel more powerful, they have a better shared sense of what’s right and what’s wrong, and they feel more closely connected to their gossip partners. Note that most people hold negative views about gossip and gossipers.

Grades: [#Ster285] Grades do not translate into any adult achievement measures. [#Csik213] Grades (as well as teacher's ratings) reflect intelligence as well as having an autotelic family; however, self-ratings and how far one will go (in courses) are more influenced by motivation and personality. [#Geowissen09] Some research showed that the same essay was graded by some teachers with an 'eins', by others with a 'funf'. Even in maths: 7%=Eins, 10%=4 or 5. Hans Brugelmann. But also, if achievements are the same migrant children and busy children get lower notes than German resp. calm children. [#DeGruijterICLONVWO-examenresultatenEnSuccesInDePropedeusesGeschiedenisEnPsychologie] Average central examination results for history students is around 6.75, only something like 7% having and 8 or higher. Still, only 25% gets propedeuse in 1 year. 50% in 2 years; around 7.0 is the cutoff point. If students get their prop in 1 year, average grades are around 6.85, for 2-years around 5.93 – Sds of 0.40 and .45 resp. Psychology: average grade of first year stuydents is around 6.25! In short: there is no big correlation between central examinattion results and grades/study success, though slightly more between average exam results (including school results) and study success; but selecting on grades would generally eliminate very many students, many of them quite suitable.

Graham, Martha: [#Greene66] Decided when she was young to learn to live on as little as possible and spend most of the time possible on learning new skills.

Graham, Paul: [#Greene232] PhD in computing, pattern of part-time consulting job to earn money, then quit and devote his time to his real love, art and painting. [EW: not seduced by material goods, high O?/easthetics]. Hated consulting.When developed first web shop, were also de facto salespeople, and first to hear complaints and suggestions. Later started to study technology startups in general, and decided to give guidance to others. Y Combinator. Found that succcessful entrepreneurs university and idea did not matter too much, but their character di -willingness to adapt their ideas and take advantage of posibillities they had not imagined. Fluidity of mind. Other essential character trait was supreme tenacity.

Grammar: [#Laird53] A good computer program produces only those things that obey a certain grammar; grammar is automatically enforced through the structure of a program, even indeterministic programs can produce results which are randomish, but still obey the grammar. [#Evans173] Semantics are needed to judge something grammatical; ‘Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’ is okay, but ‘Arboreal mammary media paragraph well’ not.

Grammar of schooling: [#Hatt5] The basic structure of schools: age-grading of students, division of knowledge into separate subjects, self-contained classroom with one teacher. Has remained constant for at least 200 years. One of the extra assumptions is that students are responsible for learning, so if the student does not learn, it is his/her fault, or the fault of his/her parents or ethnical group.

Grandin, Temple: [#Greene43] Was diagnosed with autism at age 3. Had very active mind, but would get feelings of anxiety without anything to concentrate on. Had high powers of concentration – could read for hours on a subject without getting bored. When she wanted to study cattle chutes, professors in her department told her it couldn't be done – so she found other professors. Didn't try to be like others but directed herself to the small things she was good at {EW: though she also had to learn how to work with people, that is not a luxury}

Grants: [#Eyse284] Grant-giving committees at least do not like to take risks and do not encourage creativity. [#C2W120413] Jeroen Codee, UD: applying for money costs at least one day every working week. [#Imagine243] The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which gives grants to risky research based on examples of past research, produces better science than the NIH {EW: but they may be funding better scientists as well?} [#Hargit140] If Marshall Nirenberg had applied for grants, chances were that it would have been denied since he completely lacked experience in the area. [#Greene212] Especially those who get large grants become embroiled in political games, substitute technology for their own thinking, and are conservative in their conclusions. [#Jansen42] reviewers may have just 5 minutes per grant proposal. Trick: Jansen sent the research background to a Nature journal, editors and reviewers helped it, it becoming a perspective, and also being usable as background section for the proposal. [#C2WMedicinesOct13] Rubicon: granted 17 of 90 contestants, so about 19%/

Graphics: [#Clar170] Graphics, when added to text, greatly enhance implicit encoding – the multimedia principle. Note that simpler graphics are often better. Note that most graphics in school texts are decorative: add humor or look pretty, but do not transfer content.

Gratefulness: [#Lyubom93] Grateful people are more likely to help others. [#94] Gratitude may help against hedonic adaptation.

Great work: [#Newport43] Great work defined by creativity, impact and control (autonomy over working day)

Greeks: [#Weiner24] On blossoming of ancient Athens: Greeks always wanted to be the best, in contrast to the Egyptians. [26] Athenians did things for their city, “civic joy”. Athens was not rich, but “Paradise is antithetical to genius” - wealthy places and people often stagnate. In ancient Athens, private wealth was all but forbidden / was frowned upon. Salaries for all professions very similar. (EW: so perhaps excelling was a way to get status?) But there was public wealth, so Athens could attract the best of craftsmen. Note that the Greeks were not very interested in technology, saw it as a 'low pursuit'. So places of genius are not universal![44] No respect for 'packhorses'. Lots of confidence, bordering on hubris. Their genius may have been helped by everyone doing everything (so pre-specialization). Also Greeks sought elegance. But did not care overmuch for good food! Note that Athens had a harbor, and they tolerated foreigners, and even local eccentrics. Were also very aware of their mortality (plagues and such). Stimulated good citizenship by ostracism. Note that they occasionally also ostracized 'the best' – especially if people started to think that they themselves and their glory became more important than that of Athens. [63] Note that the Athenic flourishing did not last long; after 30 years or so, people started to accumulate money, professional entertainers and gourmet chefs came into being.

Greeting: [“OmdatHetNietMoet”Diekstra] If students when entering and leaving a classroom greet each other and the teacher, they absorb more of the lesson contents.

Grit: [#Flourish122] Combination of high persistence and high passion for an objective. More highly educated and older people have more grit than younger people. Also correlates with grades corrected for SAT. [#CoyleT111] Is important predictor (at least for West Point cadets), and can be cultivated.

Grittiness: [#DPinkDrive125] Grittiness [spending most time and effort on the mundane tasks that matter for performance 'perseverance and passion for long-term goals'], rather than IQ or standardized test scores, is the best predictor of college grades at West Point.

Groening (Matt): [#Robi18] Matt Groening loved drawing as a child, and made 20-30 drawings in a lesson, though he didn't really aim much for realism. At a certain point, he started to focus on stories and humor more (hence 'the Simpsons'). He was mainly inspired not by technically proficient drawers, but by those with original stories and a striking own style. Father was cartoonist too, but discouraged Matt from following in his footsteps. Got friends with same interests in highschool, made movies together, and made cartoons. Had some stubbornness too (or never lost his playfulness?)

Grooming: [#NS240514TheBrightStuff] (Or light stroking, the the case of humans), triggers the release of endorphins in the brain, which makes you feel relaxed and trusting. The bigger the group, the more time the animal spends on grooming,but the fewer individuals it grooms (larger groups are stressful). Humans can scale up grooming to a whole group, using laughter, singing and dancing, and language (including rituals/religion)

Group decision making: [#OptimallyInteractingMindsBahrami] The model which best explains results of decision making is weighted confidence sharing, meaning that the confidence in knowledge is communicated as well. Two heads are therefore better than one, unless the sensitivity of one if the heads is worse than (about) 40% of the other head. Anyway, communication needed (about confidence), feedback was not needed. Note that in many other situations, groups do not perform better than their best member.

Group learning: [https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3459] People placed in groups (e.g., in classrooms or study groups) typically lose a sense of responsibility. When adults were asked to describe what important things they learned and how they learned them, they typically mentioned things for which they had taken individual responsibility. They seldom mentioned learning in groups, especially in groups with leaders {EW: but don't ask-principle?} Learning is especially likely to be suppressed when people are in groups with capable people because, following the free-rider effect, they allow the skilled people to do the work (see the meta-analysis by Karau and Williams 1993). Also, whereas task-related diversity improves group creativity and productivity, bio-demographic diversity does not; in fact, a meta-analysis by Horwitz and Horwitz (2007) found negative effects.

Group selection: [#Flourish145] Breeding the clutch of hens that produces most eggs may be a better strategy than breeding individual hens that produce most eggs, as they can quarrel with each other

Group size: [#C2W160516]RichardHoogenboom ideal group size may be around 15 people, if you get more than 20, you will generally spend too much time managing to still be a 'betrokken professor'. [#Catmul] Group size is bad for candor, but depends on group. Still, always adjust if there seems to be a problem.

Grouping: [#Rost104] Eminent artists and scientists have a higher portion of abstract categories on an object sorting test {EW: does that mean they have deeper domain knowledge?}

Grouplet: [#PinkDrive105] Small, self-organized team with almost no budget and no authority, dedicated to changing something in the organization.

Groups: [#http://www.vkbanen.nl/onderwijs/742904/Hoe-maak-je-de-btavakken-leuk.html?utm_source=redactionelenieuwsbrief&utm_medium=nieuwsbrief&utm_campaign=20090507] By first letting students discuss in groups which battery makes the lamp burn brightest or longest, students naturally learn the concepts of power and current. [#NRCcaree] Splitting a company if its size exceeds 50 employees can keep a family feeling that encourages productivity. [#NS050507] Groups of like-minded individuals seem to drift to extreme positions. [#Hatt94] Dividing children in a class in groups has small positive effects (d=0.20, approximately). Assigning a task to the small group is better, d=0.5. Note that one needs to adapt materials and give specific group work instruction. [#Hatt226] Working in heterogenous groups is (at least for students) more effective than working in homogeneous groups, and is also more effective than working alone. [#59sec212] Being in a group tends to polarize your opinion, depending on the opinions of the other group members. Compared to individuals, groups tend to be more dogmatic, better able to justify irrational actions, more likely to see their actions as moral, and more apt to form a stereotypical view of outsiders. [#NS260512] For optimal performance, everyone in the group should get his or her say; and groups also benefit from people who are more sensitive to other's moods. If children think together, they engage in tasks more effectively, and use better reasoning as they solve problems. Also gives better exam results “Thinking Together”, Neil Mercer. Works best with 'exploratory talk', where ideas can be openly aired and criticized, and entered with clear goal of seeking agreement, even if the goal seems elusive. [#Seligm145] Groups can be 'tuned' (?) by things like laughing, singing and marching.

Groupthink: [#Dwec135] Churchill had a special department to give him all the worst news. Alfred Sloan asked his people to have a night's sleep over their 'unanimous' decisions. [#Robi148] Group think may lead people to worse decisions because they do not want to be disagreeable by contradicting others. [#Tigg61] Groups can make irrational decisions by faking unanimousness. This can be prevented by having devil's advocate or external expert, critical chairman, concentrating discussions on areas of uncertainty and making temporary decisions which may be revoked next time. [#Gold93] Authoritive leaders should ask for the opinions of the others first (especially to prevent groupthink). Outside experts can also help. [#Nass109] Like Lincoln in his 'team of rivals', bring together people with strong opinions and different points of view, remind team members that they are bonded by working on the same problem and by understanding each other's point of view to find the right answer. Groups striving for unanimity tend to polarize, get a 'risk shift', going to decision where upside is largest, even if downside is much more probable. This is people like positive commentators more than negative ones. When people feel identification with a group the desire to be liked and accepted and overcome the desire to accuracy or perceived intelligence.

Groves, Leslie: [#Crop355] Certainly not an academic, had little tact and could be a bully. Big ego, but had absolute confidence in his decisions, and was absolutely ruthless in his approach to problems to get them done, so was superb supervisor.

Growing brain: [#Coyl218] Teaching children how the brain grows when it is challenged has significant positive results on study skill.

Growth mindset: [#Dwec7] People with a growth mindset believe that you can cultivate your basic qualities through your efforts. They work on fixing bad things (working harder for class, making it up with a friend) rather than hating themselves or life. {EW: may need less early success in phase I, but more challenge to enjoy it?} Are often more honest about their opinions, and disagree openly (whereas fixed mindset tends to promote groupthink {EW?}) [#Syed126] Further experiments by Dweck showed that the manipulated mindset reverted back to its former value after some time.

Guests: [#NS080314] Many successful entrepreneurs, leaders and artistic high achievers grow up in stimulating homes surrounded by a diversity of books and are party to inspiring meal-time conversations. [#EW: would good house guests help?]

Guided discovery: [#EricB257] The guided-discovery group in tennis did not get much better or worse results than the explicit-instruction group. {EW: why? And consistent with Pirsig? ? Pirsig succeeded because he needed to create a gap/motivation first. No gap – no attention. Tennis players probably had a natural gap/motivation already} [#Clar273] Guided discovery works better than pure discovery, pure discovery has too much cognitive processing and builds the mental models too chaotically instead of step by step. [#Stol111] Third of four training methods, guided discovery basically plunges the learner into a case, the trainer is mainly for feedback and guidance if needed. Only works if the learners already have a decent degree of competence and confidence.

Guilt: [#Peal25] Some people cannot be peaceful since they feel guilty of something, and must forgive themselves first. [#Burn198] Guilt stems from two thoughts: I have done something I shouldn't have (or haven't done something I should have) and 2) therefore I am a bad person. The second part creates the difference with remorse or regret. Usually based on distorted thinking, especially should patterns that expect you to be omniscient and totally in control of yourself and others. Can also be distinguished from healthy regret by the intensity, duration and consequences. If you really made a mistake, recognize that an error has occurred, and take measures to correct the problem. Should's can often be replaced by “It would be nice”, or by “realistic” thinking “no, you should have eaten that icecream!”. Note that guilt can be used by others to manipulate you into doing things that are not in your own best interests. [#Pino155] Replace “ If only I had...” by “Next time I'll do...” [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201101/autopsy-the-abandoned-new-years-resolution] Guilt and shame, thinking of how bad you'd feel after doing something, tends to undermine willpower [EW: willpower depletable resource, neg emotions depleting it-phenomenon] Imagined guilt also increases anticipated pleasure, making people more likely to do something.

Gummbah: [#Busa106] Has been obsessively drawing since kindergarten, sort of physical necessity/urge. If his classmates had to laugh about it, he was 'opportunistic' enough to continue on that line/experiment. But there are also other drawers in his family. Doesn't consider drawing work, it's so much fun (though in general he has a great zest for life). Jumps out of his bed at 6 o clock because he loves to draw. Was ashamed of saying he wanted to draw for a living when he was a child, however. Does feel need for approval/applause. Though he has the trick of looking at his work after a week, and throwing away 90%. Also uses Hans Teeuwen as sounding board, to see if it works, to prevent fooling himself. Is drifting towards language now, but sees in cartooning less competition. Thinks that all excelling persons are rather fanatic, though he sees his own fanaticism lessen (age?/hormones?gf?)

Gut: [EW/ http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shyness-is-nice/201111/the-shyness-project-inspirational-interview-brittany] Good motivation should hit you in the gut. I really advise that if you're going to confront your own painful shyness, that you be 100% committed to it and want to do it for your own sake and not anyone else's.  Make sure you're focusing on the aspects of your shyness that you feel interfere with your life.

Guts: [#White14] Guts may be more important than talent.

Gv: [#EricB590] Visual processing. (compare Ga for auditory processing, and the Gf etc.)

H-index: [#NRC180912] Predicting H-index for neuroscientist in 10 years: 1.33 x sqrt (#public) – 0.41 * (year since first public) + 0.52 * (# journals in which you published ) + 0.85 * (#papers in top journals ) + 0.48 [current H-index ] + 8.73

Habit zone: [#Hooked30/31] The habit zone depends on frequency and perceived utility, though with frequency dominating.

Habits: [#EW] A habit is essentially an action performed often, mainly in a specific circumstance (for example, my father would always slice a banana when he had breakfast). Habits are automated choices, often good (like sports every Monday and Thursday), sometimes bad (smoking, drinking lots of alcohol when depressed). Habits can be quite hard to change, as they usually give some 'reward' when executed, either being an actual reward (the pleasant taste of banana), or by giving a sense of security and control. [#Sidis] Boris Sidis warns against habits, and advocates exposing children (and adults?) to always changing circumstances, forcing them to adapt, think and become creative. {EW: this is possible, but there is probably a “sweet spot”. Without security at all, people get stressed. Without changes, bored. Most children are probably much more explorative than their parents though. Or does uncertainty create a more curious person than certainty or stability?} [#Weng6] It is good to step back and look at ones habits once in a while. [#Gall44] Changing a habit may involve both observing well what you do now, as well as trying out the new behaviour first in your imagination and later in a stress-poor environment. Repeat until you automatically do it right. Your habit served a function/goal: try find a better way to achieve that goal. While there is something like a 'groove', you can try to prevent getting into it. [#EW] Habit may be stronger than motivation. [#Tigg174] Every habit that leads to a nice consequence or avoiding something unpleasant is more or less addicting. [#More9] Habits make things effortless [EW: like getting up at 7:15 becomes natural?] [#Wise144] It's easy to get into habits or routines, but accidents (such as a suitcase with your act being stolen) can force you to refresh and be creative. [#EW] Breaking habits by 1) visualizing situation and new/appropriate response (multiple times, spaced repetition?), (self)roleplay, practice in [#CoyleT102] Don't try to break old habits, build new, overriding ones. [#Hooked27] Infrequent behaviour can also become a habit, as long as it has very high perceived utility. [#Hooked31] Forming habits can take from a few weeks to more than five months, depending on the complexity of the behaviour and the importance of the habit to the person. [#Hooked34] A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of pain or an itch- a feeling that causes discomfort until it is satisfied. [NS160116] Average time needed to cement a new habit is 66 days, but varies between 18 and 254. Inhibiting the orbitofrontal cortex makes mice more habit-driven, stimulating it makes mice more goal-driven (eat when hungry). Orbitofrontal cortex + medial part of striatum (caudate in humans) are important for goal-driven behaviour, the lateral part of the striatum (the putamen in humans) is important for habits. People who are more likely to make 'slips of action' (fall back into habits at inappropriate times, like driving towards work when they meant to drive to the grocery store) have stronger connections between the putamen and cortex, compared to more 'goal-directed people' who have stronger connections between the caudate and the cortex; 'goal-directed' people also have less difficulty unlearning old rules and implementing new ones. [NS160116ForceOfHabit] The striatum is important for habit formation; brainwaves in the striatum slow down and become more coordinated as soon as a rat has learned a maze and is traversing it habitually.Basically fire this way at the beginning and end of a habit, like to signal when the habit is to take over and when it again should release control. The infralimbic cortex may also be important; if that is removed, animals either abandon their habits or at least act in more goal-directed ways.

Habituation: [#Ster144] Creative people show slower habituation to at least tones; perhaps they habituate to everything more slowly, and that's why they can stick with problems longer? [#Tigg106] The phenomenon that after a while we do not perceive constant things, such as the ticking of a clock. Habituation also blinds us for slow change.

Habituation learning: [#Kluw245] Habituation learning consists of two processes: habituation and sensitization.

Hacking: [#EW120713] There may be a difference between doing things efficiently and hacking – hacking being that you employ the weaknesses of the other person, and that if another person had true knowledge of your skill or the product, he would not like that (such as hacking your way through college).

Halberda, Justin: [#http://www.wisconsinacappella.com/what-can-make-a-genius-bbc-horizon/] Investigates the link between innate number (dots) estimation capabilities and maths skill. Correlates well at lower range, but for average person, correlation with maths ability fades.

Haldane: [#Hald] Haldane had lots of guts (dared speculate publicly on health effects of space travel in the pre-space era), a great sense of wonder (very curious). Bit feeling of self-importance (one of the most influential people alive). Set himself up for criticism by being clear. First wife was journalist.

Halo effect: [#www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/TEs%207.doc ] The effect that one positive characteristic of someone leads an evaluator to infer other (non-existing) positive characteristics, for example teachers assuming since girls are generally more obedient and cooperative, they also work harder than boys (for which there is little evidence). [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201106/are-you-making-these-two-dieting-mistakes] But also works by association: putting salad next to a hamburger makes people think that the complete meal has less calories than the hamburger! (that's probably why you don't want to be seen with losers/uncool kids) [#Nass169] The halo effect also makes neutral characteristics (for example, an European accent) be interpreted as charming or annoying depending on whether the person seems nice or cold. [#McGon99] A 'health halo' exists: if we have ordered something healthy, the next indulgence does not feel sinful at all. The more we care about a virtue, the bigger the effect of the halo.

HAM: [#Pers120] High achievement motivation, contrast to LAM. HAM's seek challenges and feedback.

Hamilton, Rowan: [#Crop120] Great Irish mathematician and physicist, did excellent work in ray optics and particle dynamics, but after initial successes meandered off in a direction to rewrite physics in his quaternions; became a recluse, living in his dreamworld.

Handicap: [#NRC171211] People who are emotionally stable, have trust that they can handle their handicap well, and have positive 'disease-cognitions' (not: I can't... but I can spend more time on...) and feeling in control.

Hands: [#Greene64] Would working with our hands, like tinkering, improve our thinking?

Hands-on: [#Hatt44] Hands-on-programs are more effective than those relying on passive information transfer, via videos and such.

Happiness-luck interference: [#EW] People who are happier will generally feel luckier, and also be luckier (as they attract partners and jobs more easily, etc.) Similarly, luckier people will feel happier. Luckiness and happiness are not independent!

Hard questions: [#McGraw15] Would most people cheat themselves by not asking themselves the hard questions? What, in your heart, do you know to be a problem not acknowledged or at least so painful that you avoid it? [#Schmid250] Ask the hard questions even if you don’t have answers. Advantage is that it keeps the people from being too comfortable, and it mitigates the risk-averse culture companies may otherwise have “an imminent hanging concentrates the mind wonderfully”.What could be true in 5 years? How would a very smart, well-capitalized competitor attack the company’s core business? (also lots of questions on the next few pages)

Hard work: [#http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110831/full/477020a.html] One neurosurgeon keeps his people motivated to work long hours by letting patients come in the lab and tell their story. ?Also selects people with the right kind of personality and asks slackers to leave [?is it selection or also the lab's atmosphere?] + Gives autonomy on hours and projects; more hours better ? Stack, S. Res. Higher Ed. 45, 891-920 (2004). | Article | , Biochemist Philip Cohen of the University of Dundee, UK, says that of the 70 postdocs and nearly 50 students he has supervised during his career, the most successful were those who put in long hours and worked efficiently.

Harmony: [#Csik158] The second dimension of integration, harmony refers to whether a family is ordered (calm, consistent members and rules).

Harvey, William: [#Greene150] Involved his colleagues in further experiments and dissections, always eliciting their opinions.Published (at long last) his results in a thoughtful, well-reasoned, and easy-to-read book.

Haskell: [#Clar234] Researcher who concluded that there was little empirical evidence that the millions of dollars spent in training had any positive effect on employee effectivity or attitudes.

Hausen, Harald zur: [# ] Nobel-prize winner Each of my mentors gave me a lot of freedom, which I enjoyed very much, so I have some difficulties to pick one out. But, I had a good time with Werner and Gertrude Henle at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Have-to: [#Csik145] While maths and science students usually feel they have to work rather than want to work, arts and sports talents have the reverse; for music students it is about equal. Importance (to others) parallelled the 'have to' dimension.

Hawking, Stephen: [#Crop452] Both parents had been educated at Oxford; father became researcher in tropical medicine, mother vivacious and friendly became a secretary, for which she was ridiculously overqualified. Rather eccentric family; father didn't care for appearances as long as it allowed him to save money, mother had been communist. Once embarked on a yearlong cartrip to India. Stephen was not a prodigy in the classroom (performing about halfway), but used his creativity and time at home to construct working models and elaborate games {EW: preference for complex, demanding activities?} Modeled himself after his father, also a researcher, but father pushed him from math/phys to phys/chem, as mathematics was only a preparation for teaching; this handicapped Hawking in his physics work, but perhaps not too much as Hawking prefers to think in pictures instead of equations. Entered at Oxford which had antiwork-attitude: be brilliant naturally, or accept 4th class degree. Feeling of boredom, 'nothing was worth making an effort for'. Fascination for being in control of events. In Cambridge, wanted to study under Fred Hoyle, most famous astrophysicist of his time {so he knew who were famous}, was however assigned to Dennis Sciama, who created a very friendly and stimulating environment for his students, since he had some kind of metaphysical angst for not understanding the universe, and his students helped him tackle the complex problems faster. Got depressed by the news of having ALS, but found solace in Wagner, and thinking of the young boy in the hospital dying of leukemia, who was at least worst off than he was. Partly got lifted out of the depression by his own strength and help from others, like his fiancee-wife. Hawking began to work hard and found out he enjoyed it. [Sciama also had a great group, including Martin Rees.] Worked together with Penrose: Hawking's intuition together with Penrose's mastery of maths. Wrote popular book due to increasing medical expenses and children's school fees [being a scientist apparently doesn't pay too well]. Was smart/needed money and therefore went to a clever literary agent. Needed the guidance of good editor, Guzzardi, though to make it readable (still only relatively so; it has a reputation of being unreadable but it CAN be read by a patient and curious reader, the ideas are complicated but Hawking does not talk down to the reader). Marriage was under great strain; wife felt appendage, and desire for own career and motherhood conflicted as well {feeling of importance? Not a typical 'great-man's wife', but perhaps modern times make that more difficult} Hawking has heavy workload, but manages it psychologically due to undestructible optimism, and, as daughter put it 'do what he wants to do at any cost to anybody else'.

Hawthorne effect: [#EW081211] Is the Hawthorne effect a kind of disguised Mozart effect, with mood improving performance (either through boosting neurotransmitter levels or increasing wellbeing/not being distracted so easily by sad thoughts. I wonder what is the case...).

Haydn: [#Weiner245] Haydn also did not care much for money.

Headlines: [#Pino56] Imagine the headlines in the newspaper about the trial you're preparing {EW: or musical?}instead of just seeing it as a logical task to be done {EW: no motivation?}

Headstart effect: [#Switch126] People are more motivated to finish something they have already partly finished, than to start and finish a new task: a card for eight stamps works much better when two stamps have already been given {EW: could also be 'repaying' of social debt?}

Health: [#NS240115 Health of Nations] Healthy, successful lives tend to be lived by people with a sense of purpose and meaning. They feel that they are masters of their own fate rather than being at the mercy of events, have a positive outlook and see problems as challenges to overcome. [#Markus10] Japanese with the best relationships with family and friends are healthiest, Americans are healthiest (even though relationships are also important) when they have a sense of control.

Heart: “A genius is the one most like himself” - Thelonius Monk.

Heart rate variability: [#McGoni39] Anxiety, anger, depression and loneliness are all associated to lower heart rate variability [and less self-control]; to increase it, practice a few minutes of slow breathing (4-5 breaths per minute). Higher HRV also helps willpower all the way. Alcoholics with lower HRV when they see a drink have a higher risk of relapse. [#Flourish208] Increased HRV also increases health and cognitive abilities.

Hearthstone: [#EW] Like in dating, it is fun to win, but win or lose, ask the question: what did I learn? Like hunter = explosive trap & send in the hounds, making having loads of low-health minions a bad idea.

Hebb rule (and anti-Hebb): [#Kluw35] The Hebb rule states that if the activity of a pre- and postsynaptic neuron is correlated, their connection will be strengthened, else weakened. Anti-Hebb means that neurons within an ensemble will try to decorrelate their activity, to allow greater spatial resolution and less redundancy in information processing.

Hedonic adaptation: [#Burkem33] Can be reversed by imagining how you may lose the things you value (imagine the cup already broken).

Hedonic happiness vs hedonic enjoyment: [#Franzen276] Hedonic happiness seems related to being challenged, having clear goals, feeling competent, making an effort, being assertive [EW: attention/concentration], hedonic enjoyment: relaxation, amusement, feeling content, forgetting one's troubles.

Hedonism: [#Csik240] The young talented people were not hedonists who avoided hard work and self-discipline. They worked very hard, but did not feel anxious and pressured while doing so.

Hedonistic habituation: [#59sec38] To prevent hedonistic habituation, change the stimuli (a new game, a new hobby...

Height: [#PoorEcon31] Corrected for IQ, there seems no relationship between height and earning [EW: hmm... but is IQ not a result then of earning more?]

Heisenberg, Werner: [#Crop263] Father taught classical languages at the gymnasium, but rather stiff, authoritarian, and demanding endless precision. Mother very busy and well-educated outside university (father was rector), father was also very driven, pubished extensively, and became professor. Comfort but not always security in family (sibling rivalry with brother).Grew up in very uncertain times after WOI in Germany, seeking for identity. Father encouraged science, but Werner also considered becoming musician, in the end chose to study under Sommerfeld, who was impressive but not intimidating, austere but benevolent, and genuinely concerned for young people. Befriended Pauli. Was taken by Sommerfeld to Bohr lecture, and was inspired, but unafraid to talk to Bohr and disagree on some of his theories. Visited Bohr's institute for a few weeks. Also became an assistant to Max Born, after Pauli; impressed Born, as being easily as gifted as Pauli but with a much more pleasing personality. Got his inspiration during two weeks of absence due to hay fever. {EW: seems to have been familiar with the Fourier transform and Newtonian dynamics, as well as with Bohr's and Einstein's work} Was extremely excited during his discovery (though also made a lot of errors). Showed the work to Pauli (who was excited) and Born (also so, but who could smooth out the odd mulitiplication since he remembered matrix algebra). But mathematician Hilbert was also in Göttingen and helped them (though his hypothesis that the matrices were just a mantifestation of differential equations went unheeded).

Hek, Youp van 't: [#Busa85] Is obsessively seeking inspiration for his jokes. Example (when young) was Toon Hermans, also Wim Kan. Looked behind him at the laughing people, parents were laughing on way home. Big success at school, inspired him on. Wasn't very successful at first in Amsterdam, but was extremely fanatic (your sister's marriage is no reason to cancel a show!) Perfectionistic, always wondering why something works or doesn't work. And limits himself mainly to cabaret, does not think it wise to do too many activities like 'hanging around' in TV shows.

Helmholtz, Hermann: [#Crop71] Studied medicine (preferred maths/physics, but needed the money from a government scholarship). Doctoral student of revolutionary physiologist Johannes Müller (first of the biochemists), but even as army surgeon could provide his own intellectual stimulation by doing experiments. Had read 17th and 18th century authors such as Daniel Bernoulli. Journals did not find his paper significant, physicists attacked it as fantastic speculation. Worked extremely hard, even to the detriment of his mental and physical health. Then migrated from physiology to physics, and gathered good assistants around him (many of which laid the foundations for great work later, Bolztmann as himself, others did measurements that aided Planck and Einstein). Was a man of great kindness and integrity, but a terrible lecturer who could not communicate his passion to a group {or found it too much work to prepare?} [#Strien23] Claimed that his new ideas usually occurred while walking through nature. [#37] Solution never came when he was tired or working, but when relaxing. And of course after lots of research in/thinking about the problem.

Help hypotheses: [#Strien172] Hypotheses protecting the main hypothesis, providing alternative explanations if an experiment yields an unexpected outcome.

Help seeking (adaptive): [#EricB711] Choosing specific models, teachers or books to assist oneself to learn. Low achievers, in contrast, are often reluctant to find help because of lack of planning and fear of adverse reactions from help-givers. [#Kiefer55] Determine whom to ask for help or advice, show them your plans and ask for feedback. [#CorStutterheim] Dare to ask for help!

Helpers: [#Crop31] Halley both stimulated Newton to write the Principia, and worked hard to find fund to have it published.

Helping: [#Redirect71] People who help others are happier than people who do not. [#Sommers69] The higher the population density (city), the more difficult it is to find help. For a part also because cities are cognitively demanding. [#79] Characteristics of the helpee more important than characteristics of the helper; so paint helpee in positive light (no AIDS victim who got aids through unsafe sex). [#HaidtH133] Caring for others is often more beneficial than receiving help.

Hemisphere: [#Ster147] Creative architects seem to have higher left-hemisphere activiation, creative scientists and mathematicians seem to have higher right-hemisphere activation compared to their less creative colleagues. People who look left (slightly activating their right hemisphere) score slightly better in some creativity tests.

Heritability: [#Ster148] Creativity does not seem heritable, which may be because it is an emergent trait (intelligence, psychoticism, perseverance amongst others). Heritability in monozygotic twins reared apart seems to be about 0.54 (so 54% or 26%?)

Herman, Sergio: [#Busa69] Needs a good team around him, and is passionate about food and cooking. Has great eye for detail. Keeps a good eye on suppliers and personnel. Loves that his customers enjoy the meal, much more than Michelin stars. His parents had a restaurant, took him with them to good Belgian restaurants. Sergio himself read a lot about excellent restaurants and chiefs. But passion really broke lose after an internship with Cas Spijkers. Admires Pierre Gagnaire greatly. Needs some periods of rest for inspiration, because his work is extremely hectic. Never dares to consolidate, always wants to do something new.

Hero: [#Robi184] Heroes can inspire us, but they are not necessarily good mentors.

Hertz, Heinrich: [#Crop171] When noticing a strange phenomenon (on wires communicating without a connection), made a very thorough investigation, and showed that his electromagnetic waves could be reflected and polarized.

Heterodoxy: [#Crop21] Newton developed his own views on theology, and could not bring himself to pretend to believe in what he didn't believe in.

Heuristic: [#Eyse77] In many cases combinatorial-explosion search is impractical – creativity probably involves the use of heuristics. [#Weng108] For idea generation: what if the problem was much bigger? Much smaller? Reversed? Divisible in smaller pieces?

HHMI: [#Weiner120] Like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Pope julius II did not 'play safe', but gambled on hiring someone clearly talented and giving him an impossible task (Michelangelo – Sistine Chapel).

Hiccups: [#EW020712] When distracted by hiccups, try high 3-circle quigong for 1 to 2 minutes.

Hidden profile paradigm: [#http://connieyuan.comm.cornell.edu/publications/PSPR2012_Lu%20Yuan%20McLeod_Hidden%20profile%20meta%20analysis.pdf] If shared information leads to another conclusion than total information, decision in groups is worse. [EW: with a random distribution of + and – effects, this effect would not occur, it's therefore artificial, or at least a 'worst case' scenario'] This is because 3 effects: the more people know something, the more likely is it to be mentioned, there is social validation in repeating information given by others, and people will generally bring forth opinions that support the current 'communis opinio' or their own pre-discussion preferences [EW: so list all things that OPPOSE your preference] Increasing group size decreases the chance that unique information is contributed, but does increase the chance that the information influences the decision; overall though decision quality decreases with group size, at least over the situation where everyone knows all information. People starting with different preferences increases the quality of decision-making (so never have too-similar people). Decisions on judgements suffer more than when problems have a unique solution.

Hierarchy: [#Watt178] Storing knowledge in a hierarchy {EW such as a mindmap} can be very useful. Having a kind of overview of a science instead of unconnected facts can also help when studying. [#Medi84] A successful waiter (JC) used a hierarchical encoding strategy for orders; words presented in a hierarchical structure are remembered up to 40% better. [#EricB172] Experts (like architects) also seem to use a hierarchical representation, such as doors at the lowest level and clusters of rooms at the highest level. In GO the representation seems more pattern-based and not strictly hierarchical. {Would hierarchies ease the strain on working memory by disregarding details that are less relevant on that level? May not work that way when low-level details interfere with high-level functioning}

Higgins: [#Jaffe114] Irish genius who invented letter-symbols for chemistry before Berzelius, but was a bit vague, the system was still more complicated, and he did not press to make his system widely accepted.

High tech high: [#Imagine235] Technical high school – investigate.

High-achievers: [#NS080314] Ellis Paul Torrance: creative high-achievers are not set apart by technical abilities or achievements at school, but by having a sense of purpose, the courage to be creative, delighting in deep thinking, and feeling comfortable in a minority of one. Most important: ability to “fall in love with a dream”, preferably at a young age, and then pursue it intensively.

Hinge-point: [#Hatt16] An effect above 0.4 is above average; 0.15 is about the natural learning rate, so anything below 0.15 is definitely unwelcome.

Hippocampus: [#Wolt26] It seems that when something new is learned, the hippocampal neurons are activated. They link different cortical neurons in a triangle. Over time, the cortical neurons are linked directly and the link with the hippocampal “matchmaker” neuron weakens. [#Medi103] The hippocampus is essential for declarative memory, not for non-declarative {EW: procedural?} memory. {is procedural memory older in evolution? And what's the age of the hippocampus?}[#Grin120] Sleep allows fresh explicit memories to move from hippocampus to normal temporal cortex, so 4 h learning, 1 h sleep, 4 h learning is more efficient than 8 h learning. [#Kluw22] The hippocampus may play a bigger role as learning becomes more complex (more time between CS and US, or a more complex CS). [#Kluw61] Hippocampus may have 'division of labour' with limbic centers, the limbic centers learning the emotions/emotional responses, the hippocampus learning the detailed declarative (semantic/episodic) knowledge (so people with a damaged hippocampus are afraid but don't know why, people with damaged amygdala learn to cognitively associate a CS with a CR, but don't feel fear). [#Pers379] A smaller hippocampus may predispose you to stress and depression in the first place! (since it creates fewer new neurons, it is smaller?) [EW: could be that people who tend to stress have a smaller hippocampus because of that...] [#NRC22122011] Everybody's hippocampus has about the same size, but people with a better memory have a bigger part in the back of the hippocampus and a smaller frontal part. [#Davidson78] The hippocampus is responsible for both extinction learning (so forgetting that a roadblock existed a few years ago) and context-specific learning (so knowing that in the other cage, you didn't need to be afraid, but that that may still be the case in this cage). [#NS281115ShadowsOfThePast] Hippocampi are crucial for forming new memories, but are less essential for storage. Not involved in short-term memory (which is intact even if your hippocampi are gone). Also involved in forming autobiographical memories. Note that the hippocampi are also involved in spatial localisation, some neurons only firing when someone is in a certain place (EW: hence memory palaces?) May have evolved to first of all remember things about good/bad places. Though in people at least it also stretches to persons and objects (the 'Jennifer Aniston neuron'). Note that these neurons work on a level of abstraction – the concept Jennifer Aniston, no matter the shades or whether her name is written or spoken. Seems like we can easily store about 10,0000 concepts, and each hippocampal neuron has about a 0.1% chance of firing on any given stimulus; so about 1 million neurons per concept! People with damage to their hippocampi also have trouble imagining future events. [#GR KNOCKDOWN IN NEWBORN DENTATE GRANULE NEURONS RESULTS IN IMPAIRED FEAR MEMORY  Van Hooijdonk] The hippocampus (at least the dorsal area) does not only store spatial information, also contextual information.

Hiring: [https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3459] As shown in Hunter and Hunter’s (1984) meta-analysis of entry-level jobs, ability tests had much higher correlations with supervisors’ performance ratings than did education. Thus, by using cognitive ability tests instead of education, organizations can make better hiring decisions. [#ChemistAtWork2000-JohnBorchardt] Often employers want to avoid costly training and ask too many skills, leading to a hard-to-fill vacancy with costly delays (work does not get done, deadlines are missed); better look for problem solvers who have the key skills most critical for job success. Also be the first to speak to the candidate, let not do HR do that; much faster screening and avoids interest loss due to candidates having too many hoops to jump through of poorly-informed intermediaries. Turn all your team members into recruiters! Provide interviewees with all non-confidential information before the interview (and see how well they use it on the interview itself). Perform reference checks, especially “if you were me, would you hire this candidate?”! [#Schmid106] Is this person interesting enough to spend 6 hours with? You can also get good people by taking a risk; if someone has an ambition that his/her own company is too scared to allow (no openings in sales). Also selects for people willing to take risks, which is good! Ask questions about past experiences like “what surprised you about?” or “if I were to look at the web history section of your browser, what would I learn that isn’t on your resume?” Hierarchical hiring (a boss hiring you) may be too scary for boss – should I really hire this person, they are smarter than I am… In contrast, let people be hired by peers, and best possible people, even if their experience does not match any of the open roles. Which employee would you fear to face in ‘jeopardy?’ Also get people to talk about their passion, in that case the mask comes off (and you see how social they are or not). Ask candidates to reflect on a mistake (like ‘what did you miss about the internet in 1996’). What did you expect? What did you get right, what did you get wrong?

Historical overview: [#Seth30] Sommerfeld also started with a short historical overview of a field before delving into the current problems.

Historiometrics: [#EricB319] Trying to test hypotheses in psychology (for example, about talent) by studying (eminent) historical individuals quantitatively.

History: [#C2WQ MedicinesOkt12] Politicians learn too little from history; could have predicted medicine shortages with low money for it, for example.

History-effect: [#EW/http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/20100614/interview-john-tate-getaltheoreticus/] Reading the history of science is often much more inspiring than learning science at school, can also be much more inspiring, even if you should beware of the Tate-effect.

Hoarders: [#NS290314] In contrast with OCD, hoarders show hyperactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex and the insular cortex. So much worrying about wrong decisions that they keep the item for later appraisal. [#NS290417ExcessBaggage] People feel pleasure, joy and happiness and love towards their possessions. Regions in frontal lobe areas involved in decision making, such as those related to assigning values and making value judgements [only when judging about one’s own stuff] become hyperactive. Also in general and cognitive tasks. Intuitive regions are not active enough? Are also very aware of their potential to make a bad decision, even if it doesn’t really matter (so perfectionist qualities). Tend to pay attention to unusual details, visual regions more active (so also store location of item)

Hobby: [#Root] Learning a new hobby and keeping a journal makes you more aware of your own creative processes. Most top scientists have hobbies, often several of them!

Hoffman, Roald: [#Hargit160] In his PhD-research, first did a year under Gouterman (at Harvard), then a year to Russia, then switched to Lipscomb (C76, it was 1962). After PhD developed collaboration with Woodward (C65), who taught him a great deal, for example to simplify a discussion to its absolute essential. (also for communication)

Hole-in-the-wall question: [#Susski39] What is the 'hole in the wall'? What do people want to achieve by getting a product or service?

Holes: [#EW] Scientists need holes (or at least profit by them): something that is not understood well but is deemed important.[#Strien249] Holes are also prominent with geographical explorers and with some technical inventions, like print. Some holes are not that 'holey', like the Copernican system or oxygen. But holes can also lead to conscious or undeliberate hoaxes, like the Piltdown man and 'coming of age in Samoa'

Holistic approach: [#Ster214] Highly successful creative individuals seem incredibly focused on their area of interest, thinking for hours or even days on problems. The other side of the coin is that many creators give up on having much of a family/love/social life. Even those with wives and lovers (Picasso) often disregarded them when wanting to focus on his greater interest.

Holland codes: I/E: extraversion. A/C: Openness. S/R: empathizing

Hollowness: [#Syed194] Many great sporters get a sense of loss or depression after a much-coveted triumph. Syed blames evolution that keeps us 'hungry' for coming triumps, though alternatively, one could simply explain it by saying that usually things are not as great as was hoped-for.

Holm, Stefan: [#AD210810] Stefan Holm wanted to become a high-jumper, but people tried to dissuade him because he was too small (1m81). However, he studied biomechanics and won 4 WK and 2 EK, as well as the 2004 Olympics.

Home: [#Ster121] Creative geniuses tend to originate in somewhat marginalized home environments. [#EW] Do the parents see knowledge and studying as important? If not, attention at school may suffer. [#Zill105] A stable home makes girls less prone to adjust their norms about sexuality to MTV standards. [#SimonB91] Geniuses are more likely to come from homes that are intellectually and culturally stimulating; at least one parent who is a professional, abundance of books and magazines, foreign trips and visits to musea. Parents are also a bit older than the average, and put a high emphasis on learning. Artistic geniuses are more likely than scientific geniuses to come from homes with a weird culture (parents from different nation, religion, ethnicity) and endure hardships as a child (loss of parents, financial hardship). Firstborns more likely to go into sciences and become rather 'conventional' geniuses. Latterborns are more likely to become revolutionary geniuses or politicians. [#NS080314] Many successful entrepreneurs, leaders and artistic high achievers grow up in stimulating homes surrounded by a diversity of books and are party to inspiring meal-time conversations. But if parents split up, or emotionally unstable homes, or not receive consistent affection and responsive communication from parents and caregivers have impaired emotional and social development.

Home visiting: [#Hatt70] Helps a tad (d=0.10-0.18), but can be very effective for students with learning problems (d=0.39); parents can get information to deal better with their children.

Homeostatis: [#EW/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200912/sugar-addiction-in-your-body-not-just-your-mind] The brain adapts itself to rewards, also preemptively [so braces against impact of drugs, explaining drug deaths when people take drugs in an unusual environment]

Homework: [#Hatt10] Primary school students gain less from homework (d=0.15) than secondary school students (d=0.64). Homework is more effective for science than for math, and more effective for drills than for problem-solving or complex tasks where feedback by the teacher would be needed. Elementary school children may be distracted too easily, and not have much study skills yet.

Homospatial thinking: [#Simo31] One dreamlike process in creativity in which two images are superimposed. Compare to janusian thinking.[#Weiner165] Can also be stimulated by physically creating overlaid images.

Hook: [#Medi91] A good hook needs to trigger an emotion, be relevant, and go between (10-minute) modules. Note that third/fourth hooks can often be discarded; the audience is attentive enough by then and can sustain concentration naturally for a longer time.

Hooked: [#hooked6] 4 phases: trigger (internal/external, usually starts externally), action (easy of performing + psychological motivation to perform), variable reward, investment (user does bit of work, which also improves experience for next go-around)

Hope: [#Hargit76] Getrude Ellion went to work for Hitchings after he had promised her that there was no limit to her advancement (another company had said so, since she only had a master's degree). Besides, she was good in chemical synthesis and could read german. Had had to give up her PhD studies in the 1940s for lack of support.

Hopelessness: [#Redirect176] Young people who don't see much prospects for a good job or going to college are more likely to indulge in binge-drinking (which is a vicious cycle, of course). Interestingly, you can also predict alcohol abuse by looking at how much volunteer work others at their university did. {so may be a kind of culture?}

Hopper, Grace: [#Isaacson117] Went to work with Mauchly because he let people try things.

Hormones: [#NS130811] “Lost in the plot? The pull might be of help” - women who swallow the pill are better in remembering the central plot, women who don't are better at recalling peripheral details. [#NS121209] Pregnant women are more accurate at recognizing fearful, angry and disgusted faces.

Hot area: [#EW] Jurre found a hot area of research, as did the research neurologists. Being one of the first in a hot area can help your career tremendously.

Hothouse regime: [#Ster437] Hothouse regimens, such as Mill's and Sidis's, can produce children who do not have the rounded set of skills (social too!) to be successful as an adult. {EW: Much better to give a child slowly more responsibilities}.

How: [#Dwec64] Good teachers don't ask “Can I teach them?” -but “How can I teach them best?” [#Clar240] Teaching people 'how it works' gives more adaptable mental models than just telling them what to do. {EW: for argumentation?}

HPA: [#NS220815SuicideInTheBlood] hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is implicated in impulsive and negative thoughts. When activity of SKA2 is turned down, HPA axis becomes hyperactive.

HSAM: [#NS180812] Highly Superautobiographical Memory. May work because everything in daily life has so high emotional arousal, that all stuff 'gets sucked into memory'. At least one HSAMer has a right amygdala 20% greater than average, and more connections between the amygdala and the hippocampus. Most have normal-sized amygdala's though (which may still function differently). All seem to have enlarged temporal lobes. Also differences in the uncinate fasciculus, which connects amygdala and hippocampus to frontal cortex (damage to which impairs autobiographical memory). Caudate nucleus and other areas implicated in OCD also seem larger; perhaps some form of unconscious rehearsal?

Hubble, Edwin: [#Crop423] Man with great aspirations, who, to a large extent, achieved his goals. But seemed to be ashamed of his background. Was also extremely handsome. Father hard-bitten blend of relentless ambition and moral high-mindedness. Mother was however lovely. More contact with his grandfathers than his father, one of them built a telescope for him. Was no prodigy, but won a scholarship since he excelled in sport. Wanted to win Rhodes scholarship and study astronomy, but father did not approve of the second, wanted his son to be in the legal profession like him. University of Chicago had great physics department, though! Was wiser than his Rhodes-competitors and prepared all summer for the latin component, his sport performance helped. In Oxford, rose to the occasion of three months concentrated law studies, but had learned his lesson 'labour which is labour and nothing else becomes an aversion... Work, to be pleasant, must be toward some great end. Became Anglophile, though he also admired German efficiency. Also struck up friendship with astronomy professor. But father died of nephritis (Hubble was 23) {was hubble slighly sociopath; lying and showing other side to impress people?} Was successful high school teacher (science, maths, Spanish), as well as basketball coach. Wrote to his astronomy professor for possibilities in graduate studies, who recommended him to director of Yerkes observatory. Was offered a position at a growing and better observatory (contingent on thesis completion), but asked to keep it on hold while he enthousiastically volunteered for fighting in WWI. Lingered afterwards in England near Cambridge, meeting the important astronomers there, returning to the US paid courtesy call to Lick observatory. Hubble was very sure of himself, of what he wanted to do, and how to do it. Used the work of two of his colleagues (cephid pulses as distance measurements). Did get arguments with Dutch astronomer, Van Maanen who claimed that the rotation of those galaxies would mean that the outer stars would have to be moving faster than light; Shapley took his friend's side and also earned Hubble's disdain. Both gentlemen were not easy, and even when van Maanen agreed to copublish to settle the differences, Hubble still refused. Also hated Shapley, both intensely ambitious and unforgiving rivals, Hubble being the worst again. Hubble was genius though in taking uncompleted observations from others and being patient enough to carry it further with his own extensive and carefully planned observations, using not only Shapley's work, but also the redshift another astronomer had discovered. Hubble bluffed about his past though, as soldier and athlete, and it impressed his future wife, who never seemed to question his assertions. Perhaps because of that, never saw his family again and avoided his wife meeting them.

Hubs: [#Schmid254] Going to hubs helps creativity (Boston for Biotech, Silicon Valley for computer science)

Huffington, Arianna: [#Robi142] Born as Arianna Stasionpoulos, at age 13 she leafed through a magazine and saw a picture of Cambridge, deciding to go study there. Nobody supported her, except her mother, who even took her to Cambridge to take a look.

Human contact: [#Stalla9] Positive human contact gives rise to epinephrine, norephinephrine, decrease in cortisol, and increase in dopaine and serotonin and oxytocin. More attention and pleasure, less fear and worry, makes us more trusting and helps us bond.

Human engineering: [#Carnxiv] About 15% of people's financial success, even as engineers, is determined by technical skills, 85% by their skill in human engineering – ones personality and ability to lead people.

Human qualities: [#Howe17] Darwin and Einstein also had unusual capacities to make friends and navigate socially, next to their fierce focus on their scientific subjects.

Humor: [#EW] Humor has a very fast – high arousal (“I don't get it” - alarm!) - low arousal (I understand) transition, like a superpowered story. May be enjoyable because of that reason (somewhat similar to joy in AHA-erlebnis – how to make people enjoy learning?) [#Edu] Humor is good for retention in education, as long as it's functional, not continuous, and not high-brow (ununderstandable for the students). Diminishes fear of failing and increases attention and retention. [#Zill47] Humor often results from having a problem going away, even if the problem is just an inconguity. Would laughter be a release of tension, or a kind of reward for the problem solving? People with a sense of humor find it easier to deal with/get less stress from daily hassles. Induced humor induces/enhances positive affective states and relaxation. [#Nass141] Even if the jokes are lame, humor greases social interaction; better cooperation and affinity. But avoid disparaging humor, vulgar or self-deprecating hunmor, ethnic, racial and sexual humor, intellectual and wordplay humor. Only reliable humor is silly and not provocative. Jokes that fall flat are equally effective in raising the performance of the listener. [#Adams57] perceive the situation in two self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference.

Hunger: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201107/the-neurobiology-dont-shop-when-youre-hungry] Hunger (ghrelin levels) increases the value of food, but decreases the valuation of other items. Sleep deprivation (sleeping 6 hours or less per night), by the way, also chronically increases ghrelin levels. Psychological stress as well! [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201006/the-ghrelin-gremlin-or-why-you-cant-always-trust-the-bodys-wisdom] High-sugar foods, especially drinks, also do so. This is why both soda and frui juice consumption are linked to obesity. So don't trust your body's wisdom. [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/everybody-is-stupid-except-you/201106/when-hunger-leads-anger-noticing-external-influences-mood] Hunger also makes you grumpy, you get slowly grumpier after a meal until you 'fill up' again.[#NS210215ImHungryAndIWantToGoShopping-Now] Hunger lets people also purchase more non-food-items (64% more)

Hunting: [#White38] Fanatically hunting for new experiences may give you ideas of what you want, alternative to jealousy. You can also try to hunt your successes or greatest experiences of the past, to see what those teach you now

Hurston, Zora Neale: [#Greene68] American writer, very smart women. Could only get a job as a cleaner, so cleaned in the houses of rich white people, who had plenty of books which she could snatch and memorize passages from. Using a false age, subscribed herself to highschool, moved to Harlem where all the leading black writers were living. Made a study of powerful, important people, and how to impress them.

Huxley's dictum: Wamted to give scientifcally minded young people the best possible education “if our country could buy a possible Watt, Davy or Faraday, a price of 100,000 pounds would be a bargain”"The great mass of mankind have neither the liking, nor [203] the aptitude, for either literary or scientific or artistic pursuits; nor, indeed, for excellence of any sort. Their ambition is to go through life with moderate exertion and a fair share of ease, doing common things in a common way. And a great blessing and comfort it is that the majority of men are of this mind; for the majority of things to be done are common things, and are quite well enough done when commonly done. The great end of life is not knowledge but action. What men need is as much knowledge as they can assimilate and organise into a basis for action; give them more and it may become injurious. One knows people who are as heavy and stupid from undigested learning as others are from over-fulness of meat and drink. But a small percentage of the population is born with that most excellent quality, a desire for excellence, or with special aptitude of some sort or another.... Now, the most important object of all educational schemes is to catch these exceptional people, and turn them to account for the good of society. No man can say where they will crop up; like their opposites, the fools and the knaves, they appear sometimes in the palace, and sometimes in the hovel; but the great thing to be aimed at, I was almost going to say, the most important end of all social arrangements, is to keep these glorious sports of Nature from being either corrupted by luxury or starved by poverty, and to put them into the position in which they can do the work for which they are specially fitted.... I weigh my words when I say that if the nation could purchase a potential Watt or Davy or Faraday, at the cost of a hundred thousand pounds down, he would be dirt cheap at the money."

Hybrid fields: [#Davidson196] Quoting Francis Crick: “In nature hybrid species are usually sterile, but in science the reverse is often true. Hybrid subjects are often astonishingly fertile, whereas if a scientific discipine remains too pure it wilts.”

Hyperthymesia: [#Wiki] The syndrome whereby people have extremely good autobiographical memory. May be a kind of OCD whereby a person spends an extraordinary amount of time thinking about his/her past. Also unusual and obsessive interest in dates. However, memory for random (not-autobiographical) informationmay be poorer than normal. Temporal lobe enlarged (where declarative memories are stored) as is the caudate nucleus (which harbors procedural memories; is also involved in OCD)

Hypnosis: [#Wolt57] People under hypnosis are more relaxed and more concentrated, remembering things is easier then. {EW: would painting and such resemble hypnosis a bit?} [#Will56] Hypnosis makes you more certain that your memory is right, but doesn't improve real accuracy. [#Wiki] Hypnotized subjects are fully awake, just decrase in peripheral awareness.But have increased response to suggestion (EW: perhaps because the critical mind cannot function with focused thoughts?) [EW] Are good teachers hypnotizers? [#StenTurk040513] If you come into someone's comfort zone, something is already happening [EW: also put hand on shoulder]. Speak loudly, clearly and definitely confidently (I'm going get that person into hypnosis, no matter how light). Use what happens (hand rising)

Hypomania: [#SimonB129] Hypomania (a mild form of mania) may be a direct blessing to creativity, for example in Robery Schumann's case. Note that his mania and hypomania did increase his productivity tremendously, but did not affect his hit/miss ratios.

Hypothesis: [#CIAch2] A hypothesis is quick to form, but resistant to change. The blurrier the initial picture is, the more difficult it is/the longer it takes/the more unambiguous information is needed to break out of the initial hypothesis and achieve a better hypothesis. It is therefore useful to make the assumptions (and uncertainties in it!) explicit, and aggressively seek alternative views or explanations.

I: [#TIE-article] Intellect, seems related to Openness in the Five Factor Model, but not identical to it. Intellect may in reality better reflect IQ and working memory capacity.

IAL: [#Meie4] The International Alliance for Learning; focuses on effective novel teaching and learning methods.

Iceberg illusion: [#Syed21] When we see extraordinary feats, we see the end result of a process measured in years. The process itself, like the part of the iceberg under the water, is hidden from us.

Icebergs: [#Seligm168] Kind of mental blocks, like “I should not ask for help”. Ask questions: is it (does it continue to be) meaningful to you? Is it accurate in the given situation? Is it overly rigid? Is it useful?

Idea diffusion: [#EW/Gladwell] Whether an idea diffuses, depends on three factors: its quality (affected by the mavens), its communication channels (affected by the connectors) and its convincingness/ability to change how people act (affected by the salesmen).

Idea generation: [#AltucherThe Ultimate Guide for Becoming an Idea Machine] Buy a waiter's pad (also helps break the ice in conversations). Advises to generate 10 ideas (or whatever number of ideas is hard, makes you sweat. If 6 is easy, create 10!) If you can't come up with 10, come up with 20. If there are ideas you'd like to execute, get paper, divide into 2 colums. First = list of ideas. Second = First steps. Altucher also tries out ideas simultaneously (about 10?) “Failing quickly is a better skill than executing quickly”. Also works with seeds (10  old ideas I can make new, 10 ridiculous things I could invent, 10 books I can write, 10 business ideas for Google/amazon/twitter, 10 people I can send ideas to, 10 podcast ideas I can do, 10 industries I could remove the middleman. 10 things I disagree with that everyone else assumes is religion (college, for example), 10 people I want to be friends with and the first steps to contacting them, 10 items to put on my idea seed list, 10 things I learned yesterday.  10 things I learned from X, 10 things I can do differently today, 10 ways I can save time, 10 things I am interested in getting better at (and 10 ways to do so) 10 things I was interested in as a kid and which may be fun to explore now. A problem I have and 10 ways I might try and solve it. Altucher also reads before writing down ideas, 10% of a non-fiction book or inspirational book or good fiction book, or a puzzle book (but has 10-20 books on his list). Needs 6 months of practice. Always give away ideas for free, 100%. Half makes you hoardy.

Ideal self: [#Franzen16] Are people led in their choices by striving for an 'ideal self'?

Idealism: [#Franzen269] People with a strong social feeling see their commitment to a social cause as highest goal in their lives, and judge their role from that. 'Making the world a better place'.

Ideas: [#Root] The more successful scientists usually work on diverse projects, and get more ideas while relaxing (so not at work) – clearly, scientific problems really occupy their mind. [#RootITCT] 'The artist is not a man who describes, but a man who FEELS' – all ideas start with a kind of feeling/impression, and is only later translated into some form of communication. Writers are not people who think in words – they are people who express themselves preferentially in words. [#John195] The same idea when communicated to others will always activate different and possibly new productive associations in other people, and therefore gets modified slightly. [#Deichmann17] Idea quantity is related to idea quality. [http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2013/de-snaartheorie-link-tussen-zwarte-gaten-en-supergeleiding.html] “Maar echte ideeën krijg je niet in je eentje op een zolderkamertje. Die moet je heen en weer pingpongen.” [#Hargit210] Marshall Nirenberg puts down his ideas every evening in his notebooks. So far has collected thousands of ideas in forty volumes. [#Strien23] Ideas seem to come in dreams/half-sleep, during walks through nature (Helmholtz), or when reading 'for amusement' a book of Malthus (Darwin). [#26] Getting the idea seems like a peak experience in which everything around the scientist disappears [#27] Of course, it can take many years of work for one 'creative idea' to be ready to show the world. [#135] Benedictus (chemist AND ARTIST!) observed a falling bottle not breaking but glass sticking together: noted date and previous contents. Only realized application after reading twice about car passengers being injured by glass. [#145] Some knowledge is so general that it doesn't really count as serendipity: Huygens need not have looked at water to come up with his wave theory of light. [#Adams46] Newly formed ideas are fragile and imperfect; they need time to strengthen. They can also lead to other ideas. Judging them too early serves no purpose. [#Catmul] Right people + right chemistry > rigt idea. (Good people will make even a mediocre idea shine). “Early on, all our movies suck” {EW: should you never harm a bad idea?} [#Schmid6] Google uses inter-company spreadsheet of 100 projects, 1-5 rating, and new/far out and skunk works.

Identification: [#EricB577] The more you identify yourself with someone else, the more you deem the person's activities important. (Role of role models? The same name/birth date?). For example, while white students considered George Washington the most important American, African-American students gave that consideration to Martin Luther King (and did not have any white person in their list, in contrast to the white students!). Or did they mention the black people because they considered their cause (equality) more important? Remy's bald friend... Magdalena German sporter with her Magdalena role model. Dentists called Dennis. [#More40] Identification [EW: other meaning] is used to identify all the skills that you lack to master a skill set. Ask questions: 'What is the perfect way to do this module?' and 'How does this differ from how I currently am able to do it?” [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201007/the-sleeper-effect-single-cigarette-why-just-once-spells-bad-news-] Identifying yourself as a 'smoker' (so a risk taker, like the other cool kids) may make you more likely to persevere in the habit and get addicted. [#Wallin40] Identifying yourself with someone also makes you more likely to blame that person's troubles on adverse circumstances, rather than character or his/her own actions. [#http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2011/van-seksistische-werksituaties-worden-vrouwen-queen-bees.html?utm_source=110628-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=van-seksistische-werksituaties-worden-vrouwen-queen-bees&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] When reminded of gender discrimination, women who don't identify with other women indicate that they are different from other women and claim that gender discrimination is relatively absent, women who do identify with other women want to help and mentor women. [#Nass101] Stronger identification with higher quantity and exclusivity of markers. Or by identifying competitor: should be very visible and very similar. [#Strien31] Darwin had about 2 or 3 more or less fertile ideas per day. [#Paul182/EW] “Ontgroening” may help form a group, similar to war, painful rituals, or simply dancing together. Being in the same situation helps people identify with each other, seeing the other more as ‘self’ and reducing internal competition.

Identity: [#Gosl66] Our identity is not constant – its elements can wax and wane over time and easily incorporate new aspects (such as 'being a writer'). Identity and its stories are not necessarily objectively “true”, but more like a myth. However, when someone attacks your personality or sees you in a different way, you will defend your identity vigorously. [#HeaB75] By giving people an identity (like first-graders 'scholars', or factory workers 'inventors') you help them adopt new behaviours {would it only work with positive, desirable identities? [#EW] The ideal 'new' identity has two aspects: it incorporates at least some aspects of the 'target identity' and is seen as positive/interesting/fascinating by the person {how relevant is 'believable?'}. [#Sommers111] Asking children for their name and on which street they lived, extra-candy stealing conformity dropped from 83% to 67%. [#Sommers117] People answer the 'twenty questions' test differently depending on contexts, because we tend to focus on what makes us distinctive (and in Japan?): a white is unlikely to identify himself as white unless he is interviewed in Chinatown. [#NS261013] Eye contact rather than knowing someone's name decreases conflict... we are less likely to transgress social norms when we know or think we're being watched. Trick-or-treaters whose faces hidden by masks steal more sweets. [#NS290314,'MyPrecious'] our possessions help shape and maintain our identity, one reason that prisons and the military confiscate stuff, to make people ready for remoulding. [EW: focusing on the right stuff could help my identity?] [#Burkeman108/EW] Our 'self' is better described as a number of independent, competing neural centres, and our identity is more like branding oneself than reality. We are not the chatter in our heads. Use the mind as a tool, instead of letting the mind use us. “I cannot live with myself” implies a separate I and myself – perhaps only one of them is real. [#EW] Would identity basically be not so much about hard rules (which is just the means), but about fitting in with a group? [#Hofste] Our identity centers around symbols, heroes and rituals. Not necessarily values. [#Eline Meijer 'This is (not) who I am: Understanding identity in continued smoking and smoking cessation'] Smokers who have a stronger identity as non-smoker find it easier to stop.

Identity model: [#Switch153] Next to the consequences model, one model for decision making. Based on 'who am I? What kind of situation is this? What would someone like me do in this situation?” Part of 'growing the people' instead of 'shrinking the change'. Ask yourself of people: would they say 'I aspire to be the kind of person who would make this change?” [#EW] Is identity influenced by what people we like/admire?

Idols: [#Tonn22] Do people admire strength and love weakness and having both in the right mix makes you an idol? [#Strien309] Stravinsky was interested in most of the arts, but meeting the composer Korsakov while he was studying (law, forced to by his father), his interests focused. Met balletimpressario 7 years later, which led him to focus on ballet.

If-then signatures: [#TheEndOfAverage-ToddRose] We have behavioral if-then signatures, for example children can be honest with friends and lie to counsellors – those may say more about us than OCEAN and such.

IGF-II: [#NRC290111] Helps brains with learning and memory, has high concentrations in hippocampus.

Ignition: [#Coyl105] A deeply emotional experience that fuels someone to dedicate him/herself to practice, see for example Clarissa {and my musical determination} [#CoyleT115] “That is who I want to be”

Ignorance: [#NS..] In most cases, the certainty of assertions/confidence of someone increases with their knowledge. However, the very ignorant can also display high confidence, because of their ignorance they cannot see their incompetence {EW: “Holle vaten klinken het hardst” in Dutch. The difference may be feedback – lack of feedback keeps people ignorant, confidence is only eroded by negative feedback} [#Watt28] Watts recommends looking at all the things and fields of study that you do NOT know to impress your ignorance upon yourself and motivate yourself to study. {EW: some highschool students could definitely use this} [#Robi143] Ignorance of someone/something being Very Important can help prevent any fear from attempting to achieve it (Arianna Stanapoulos didn't know how incredibly important the Cambridge Debating Union was in British culture, so she felt no fear of applying to its presidency).

IHMC: [#EricB212, www.ihmc.us] Institute for Human and Machine Cognition; provide free software for concept mapping. May have interesting newsletter.

Ikea-effect: [#NS24 dec 2011] The phenomenon that we overvalue what we made ourselves, volunteers offering almost as much for their own origami as for that made by experts, though independent people considered those “nearly worthless crumpled paper”. However, effort investment (IKEA) is only half of the increase in value, the other is “preference fit” (customisation)

Ikigai: [#Seligm193] Ikigai, having something worth living for, is also healthy.

Illusion: [#NS050915] Blind children who learn how to see immediate also fall for illusory images; those images therefore don't just work because of a learning effect – we are hardwired to see them that way! [also: apparently we have neurons which do nothing]

Image streaming: [#Weng60] Describing what you see when you close your eyes, not directing the imagination, but following it, describing everything, no matter how trivial it seems.Even blobs are good. Uses another person or tape recorder. Takes 10-30 minutes at a time. Note sensory impressions (vision, feeling), describe things rapidly. If you don't get images at once, it can help to imagine a door, and then 'opening it', or imagine you're a windblown leaf (or whatever) flying over the world. Seeking similarities in different image streams on same problem may help find a solution.

Imagery: [#Meie48] Using imagery during learning can increase long-term retention by 26%!

Images: [#Watt218] Images and diagrams and such help learning and also make it more attractive. [#Greene256] Edison had a vision/image of a city with electric light. [#CoyleT55] Use images for skills: 'let the ball kiss your foot'.

Imaginal flooding: [#Zill83] Therapy for diminishing fear by flooding the imagination with fear-provoking images.

Imaginary visit: [#Weng124] If you imagine you visit a highly advanced planet {EW: or a fantasy world?} what inventions can you copy? Of course, use rapid description too.

Imagination: [#NSLastWord] Children may not lose imagination as they grow up: it may simply be that children are indulged by adults when they use their imagination, adults are laughed at or arrested. Also, clever adults often hide their cleverness as not to humiliate or frighten those they consider less intelligent. [#NS210913] Kary Mullis said he imagined himself “down there with the molecules”

Imaging: [#Root03] Imaging is the second thinking tool; it consists of imagining something (with any sense, ears, visual, touch, muscular feelings) in the absence of the real sensations.

Imagining: [#Wolt45] Imagining a picture when shown a word increases the memory for the word itself. [#Gall42] Imagining how the ball should go helps ones body adapt and hit the ball the correct way. [#EricB500] Imagining yourself (but not another) performing a dance routine helps you remember the routine. Experienced dancers have a greater (specific!) imagining ability for dance routines – imagine themselves performing dance routines with greater ease than novices can. [#NRC] Verbs that (subliminally) induce actions, such as 'smile', have greater effect than adjectives like 'funny' on judging a text. [#59sec94] Imagining yourself doing a job (such as revising) makes you more likely to do so (and get higher grades). Using third-person perspective instead of first-person also helps, perhaps because it requires more cognitive load. [#Sommers166] Women imagining themselves in 'alpha males' shoes are much better at answering rotation questions than women imagining themselves in the shoes of family-oriented women, and as good as males.

Imitation: [#EW] Imitation is a great way to learn a skill, especially when not literally copying something, but when trying to imitate the other and thereafter compare your version with the original. KIPP stole all good ideas they could find. Matt Groening had a period in which he tried to imitate John Lennon.[#Gall40] Most tennis players find they play a lot better after watching a championship on TV. The best way is not to formulate explicitly which technique the pro uses, but let your attention just go to the part of the serve or game you find most interesting, and then 'play around' at the court; you don't have to imitate everything the pro does (some techniques might not be suitable for your level of technique or your body). How does the stroke feel? How does the stroke work? [#EW] Animals don't learn by listening, they learn by imitation. Human children are probably quite similar for a part, absorbing the parent's survival strategies without being conscious of it. [#Grin113] Eighth of nine learning methods, probably also intrinsically pleasant (dopamine?). Man is much better at it than apes. [#NS210407] One of the effects of TV or real life – we tend to imitate what we see other people do. [#Bron180] Young children imitate rather indiscriminately, without considering whether the behaviour is good or bad, so educational TV-shows that show lots of relational aggression 'teach' them to be more relationally aggressive at school “you can't play with us”. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201102/mass-hysteria-or-need-connection] More popular people may be more likely to be imitated [like the tipping point suicide epidemic?] May be stronger if imitator has a strong need (for example, to belong, to do something meaningful, to matter) [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201101/can-you-catch-bad-habits-second-hand-exposure-tv ] What your friends watch seems to have greater impact on your body image than what you watch yourself. {EW: does that mean that the impact of TV is small, but many small influences on friends multiply? Or is it because of watching TV together and seeing the other's reaction?} And, as social network researchers Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler have shown, the behaviors of people we like and feel similar to are the most "contagious." [#NS201110] Children will preferentially imitate more knowledgeable people over familiar people (from age 5), and will preferentially imitate people who conform to social norms. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2013/imiteren-tegenstander-onbewust-belangrijker-dan-winnen.html?utm_source=131203-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=imiteren-tegenstander-onbewust-belangrijker-dan-winnen&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] People even imitate opponents, the effect is even stronger than their desire to win (if the opponent whacks moles more slowly or in smaller/larger movements, people adjust their speed downwards or change their movements accordingly). [EW: would this mean that McGonigal's effect may more be about paying attention to the other than liking the other?]

Immersion: [#Ster65] It seems that highly creative persons are really immersed in their field. [#http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/09/01/tywe-review/] Immersion without lots of prior preparation is okay for Spanish, but impractical for Chinese and Korean.

Imp of the perverse: [#HaidtH20] If you set goals, the subconscious sets to monitoring it. But backfires with mental goals, if you try to suppress a thought (which may come up at random, but may be scary). Arms race in which rider and elephant try to out-control each other.

Impact: [#Pers210] The feeling that you make a difference to someone else's life is very motivating and benefits a relationship. [#Tigg96] How much a behaviour will change your life/help you accomplish your goals. [#UzziAtypicalCombinationsAndScientificImpact] Papers have the highest impact if they are written by teams, score high on median conventionality (usual pairings) 85th-95% percentile. However, also need high-tail novelty, so 10% of weirdest pairings had better be really weird. So solid conventional knowledge, ideally with a few novel/surprising ideas.

Impatience: [#Greene203] Possibly the greatest pitfall of all.Hurrying to the end or warming up old ideas will ensure a mediocre result. Develop pleasure for pain or hard work?

Implicit memory: [#Wolt34] People can learn things even if they can't remember the learning experience itself (the amnesiac and the needle)

Importance: Is it possible that if a subject is more important, thoughts related to the subject are easier to surface to consciousness? People finding writing more important seeing the subtleties and errors in a text more easily? {Or: more neurons activated by experience and pattern recognition?} [#Watt26] Watts recommends to think of the times where we used bad judgement to convince us of the importance of learning. Also he recommends later to concentrate our learning and thinking on the more important subjects. [#EWL] Importance helps mind focus on a subject? [#Robi233] The best teacher of Paul McCartney was his English teacher, who opened the hearts of the boys for literature by realizing what was important/interesting for them: sex! [#EWL] Importance may be greater in the mind for things that are near (proximity) and familiar, (+novelty, uncertainty and other speech factors) next to the emotional bonds and the importance placed on things by your social environment. Of course these are just 'cognitive heuristics', but they can help or hinder you reach your goals. Someone you never met or never saw on TV may not seem very important to you. [#EWL] Perhaps you will automatically find things more important if people around you find those things important too (parents, colleagues, etc.) Learning: greater reward = greater importance? But if you fail to succeed in what your parents deem important, would that diminish motivation (you don't care about what you CAN achieve). [#Csik230] Students who persevered in their talent domains showed both greater involvement and thinking their actions important for their future goals. [#EW] It's easier to remember the atomic number of gold than that of holmium, possibly because gold is more familiar, activates more other concepts, and thereby increases noradrenalin/attention and seems more important? (distinctiveness may help too). [#EW] time spent, attention and repetition all stress the importance of something. [#Ungexii] The most important part of a sentence (usually either the part that performs the action or is more known/familiar) often comes first ('The car hit the tree, not 'the tree was hit by the car'/' Kennedy shot' instead of 'Oswald shot Kennedy'). [#Medawar13] Any scientist who wants to make important discoveries must study important problems. It must matter what the answer is, whether to science generally or to mankind. [#Hargit] Osawa came up with the C60 structure, but did not find it important enough to do follow-up experiments or publish in English. [#89] Lawrence Bragg taught his pupils to focus on matters of central importance, to approach them directly, to waste no time on trivialities.

Impression: [#Watt176] Something impresses the memory more if you try to make it as clear and concrete to yourself as possible. [#EW] Not only used for “first impressions”, which tend to bias the brain to observe mainly expected things and discard things that are in contrast to the already-set theory, it is also a term for how memorable a certain thing is. “See it in flaming letters of fire” is a strong impression, fine print in a muddy corner is not. In general, bigger, brighter, different, more colourful, nearer and louder things make a bigger impression, probably because they seem either more important or newer. Impression is vital for learning, but apparently the brain prefers to save energy by not generating a strong impression of most things.

Impression management: [#EricB459] Many musicians engage in conscious impression management by belittling the role that practice or formal instruction has formed in their achievements.

Improv: [#SellHuman198] In Improv, you never try to get another person to do something. You make offers- you accept offers, and possibilities emerge.

Improvement: [#Edu] Especially Chinese are uncomfortable with telling others about weaknesses in their companies; asking them to contribute to improvement works much better.

Impulse: [#EW/Bennett] Most people go through their days ruled by commercials and other impulses, which has two main effects: first, that they focus on getting something rather than doing or learning something, second, that they spend too little time on each project to make a difference.

Impulsivity: [#Ster275] Artists seem to be more impulsive and less conscientous than non-artists. {EW: schizo?} [#Steel31] Impulsiveness leads to intense cravings, a lack of caution and reserve, and an inability to see tasks through.

In-tray: [#Fors112] There should be nothing in the in-tray except the things that are coming in today and are not urgent enough to be immediate or same-day. Use Tray-B as closed list at the end of the day (or start of the new day) for processing.

Incentives: [#NS241107] Rewarding people for desireable behaviour such as stopping using drugs or smoking, or letting their children go to school, with money or other material rewards, works. Against drug use, works even better than cognitive therapy! Problem is that often rewards must be given permanently to prevent relapse.

Income: [#Mehr143] Income seems positively related to IQ, but only for men. [#Hatt13] Academic achievement in low-income countries is (relative to in high-income countries) more related to pupil's social status and less by teacher quality.

Incompetence: [#EW/Peter] Incompetence can both be external and internal: external incompetence is not fulfilling the official requirements of a job (such as not being able to repair a bicycle tyre); internal incompetence is not following the social and official rules of the job (for example, doing something without asking permission of your boss first). Internal incompetence is generally punished much more severely than external incompetence {EW: possibly because you are seen as someone who cannot collaborate, doesn't agree with social norms/rejects social norms and you as bad, or is out of control? Mind the competence/likeability matrix with the two independent dimensions. Finally, an angry boss may have more emotional impact to managers than a happy customer, and it's hard to serve 'two masters'}

Incompetence trap: [#EWL01032012] If people are only superficially familiar with a field, they may judge 'experts' on their looks, clothing and friendliness. Since most of us are incompetent in most fields, people who 'game' power have an inherent advantage.

Incrementalism: [#CIAch4] Only investigating a narrow range of hypotheses, each marginally different from the other. Is not very effective in finding the best explanation.

Incubation: [#Adams48] Incubation time needed is one argument to get started well before deadlines. This also helps relaxation.

Independence: [#Spanish] Students with a greater need for independence dropped out of university more easily.[#Geowissen09] Some students can't handle the independence at the Primaria {WHY?} (but often students faltering in the normal school system blossom)

Indices: [#Strien106] Would one need to index a piece of data in different ways to use it flexibly/recognize it later? {also in the brain, of course}

Indirect reinforcement: [Franzen184] Seeing others being rewarded or punished for a behaviour may influence our own behaviour; we don't just learn from our own mistakes {EW: role models?}

Indirect research: [#Medawar11] It may not be possible to let others do the experiments and be a good scientist; experimenting is a way of thinking as well.

Individual: [#EricB154] The performance of an individual does not only depend on the capacity of the individual, but also on environmental effects and other people who interact with him or her. This makes prediction of 'whom will succeed' on the basis of scores of the individual only very hard or perhaps even impossible.

Individualism: [#Gold202] People from individualistic cultures are more likely to decide to act consistently with their previous decisions, in collectivistic cultures people are more likely to do what their peer group does too. Individualistic cultures also tend to place more importance on the informational aspects of communication rather than the relational aspects.

Inductive learning: [#Clar270] Instead of traditional directive learning, one can provide examples, ask the learners to derive content, and then ask questions or make them practice. {EW: similar to the Zen/motorcycle approach to writing} Inductive approaches take more time, but seem more suitable for far-transfer learning. And beware of too-high cognitive load! Inductive learning can also take place via conceptual simulations.

Indulging: [#RoosVonk210912] Thinking about the advantages of something makes us less alert to information on the negative side. Also, indulgers take less action (apply for jobs less frequently). However, dwellers (people who dwell on how bad things are) take as few actions and also feel miserable at the same time, so they could be considered worse-off. Contrasters both dream and then compare that to reality, and make 'if-then'-plans, which actions must be undertaken, which obstacles must be overcome. 'mental contrasting'. Will also give up on inachievable goals.

Industry: [C2WHetGaatOmSimpeleConcepten] Sef Heijnen: one should collaborate with industry, but not solve industry's problems – industry is much better in that. Task of university: do things three steps beyond current industry practice, and deliver competent scientists for industry.

Ineffective living: [#McGraw15] Denial, not checking the initial assumptions (since this lawsuit is obviously unfair, I must win!), inertia (paralysis caused by denial and uncertainty) deceptive masking [putting on a stiff upper lip, not telling others you have problems, or denying them outright] => because our society judges those with problems and alienates them – so we are encouraging people to lead ineffective, unhappy lives.

Inequality: [#NS150717ToddlersExpectBulliesToGetMore] Toddlers look longer if a puppet that just won the fight for a chair gets as many lego bricks as the ‘losing’ puppet. Is acceptance of inequality biological, or influenced by PDI in society? [#Bregma109]  Inequality interferes with economic growth, and makes even rich people unhappier; more depressions, distrust, and other social problems.

Inert knowledge: [#Clar241] Often, people possess the knowledge to solve a problem, but it is not activated since learning is very much embedded to the context in which something is learned.

Infections: [#NS270811] Men infected with toxoplasmosis tend to be more dogmatic, less trusting of others, less respectful of rules, more jealous and have longer reaction times than non-infected.

Inflammation: [#NS240115DoYouHaveAHealthyPersonality] Happiness that comes from a deep sense of purpose has been shown to reduce inflammation. [#NS050316InflamedBrainOnlyPartOfDepression] Reducing inflammation in the brain of a depressed mouse reduces anxiety and memory problems, but does not start the creation of new brain cells. [#NS170617TheFireInside]  Can be caused by being fat, by having gum disease. Can cause depression-like symptoms, and heart disease (due to overactive white blood cells being attracted to plaques). Inflammations are actually actively suppressed by resolvins, which are made from omega-3

Inflexibility: [#EricB26] Experts can be rather inflexible and handle a change in rules worse than novices. They also have trouble extrapolating their knowledge to new situations (street vendors were great at calculating prices of odd amounts, but failed at applying the same mathematics to a recipe)

Influence: [#DeMoor53/EW] People are less likely to be motivated where their influence or autonomy is small, and they don't feel participants in creating policy. [EW: also for teachers, and for computer games?] Bad communication (employees not knowing the reason for their work, or not being told about changes that affect their work) can compound this. [#Hargit132] William Bragg was subtle at directing the careers of his subordinates, he for example asked one to help with slides on the fibrous state for his lectures for children.

Information: [#Edu] Information triggers the mu-opoid receptor (also targeted by heroin). The more meaningful the information is and the more links it has to other brain parts, the more pleasurable it is (even though this decreases with repetition). [#Redirect121] Sometimes information is all you need to change behaviour: teaching teens about birth constrol slighly decreases the chance they have sex soon, but vastly decreases the chance on pregnancies.

Information (collecting): [#CIAch5] Collecting information has only limited value. After a certain minimum, decision-making does not improve, only confidence does (leading to overconfidence). Formulating and testing various hypotheses can be more useful than just 'digging for information', at least for medical students.

Information overload: [#NS160814It'sAllTooMuch] Information overload can be reduced by writing things down, as it get things out of the 'rehearsal loop'. Also using the environment: leaving thingss you want to take with you near the door. Plans also work (hence the strategies of the PUAs?)

Information seeking: [#Zill148] Children in a violent neighbourhood like to watch violent programs more (unless they were really anxious about the violence, then they avoided those programs).

Ingratiating: [#Nass78] People like computer programs who slowly match their personality more than those who always had the same personality as them. Perhaps due to 'gain' effect: first small, then larger reward feels better than larger rewards consistently.

Inhibition: Would an idea suppress other ideas from appearing, muscling its way into consciousness itself? If so, it may indeed be that an emotionally excited state easily latches on to an idea, strengthens it and thereby suppressing its competitors (which may hamper creativity). Consider also that people are more creative when depressed. {more driven to find a solution?} [#EW] As inhibition of irrelevant thoughts seems to diminish in old age (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory) would that explain why some geniuses become crazy or even more eccentric in later life?

Initiative: [#NewSc281000] Unless you're fantastically good-looking, you need to take the initiative in dating for better outcomes.

Innate: [#NS050414] Innate behaviour can be distinguished from learned behaviour as learned behaviour usually involves multiple brain regions, and is located in different places for different people.

Inner brat: [#Wallin34] By picturing your impulses (Heath's elephant) as an inner brat, you can take distance from it and deal with it more like an adult.

Inner game: [#Gallxi] In sports, what goes on in people's minds is almost as important if not more as that which goes on outside them. Means quieting the mind {?}. The fight against lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt and self-condemnation {EW: like in speeches?} [#Myst133] The inner game is FEELING that you're interesting and worthwhile and that beautiful women chase you. Needed for best seductions, however, can be slowly acquired by acting and talking as if it were true.

Inner speech: [#NS010613] inner speech helps with tasks that require planning and control; articulatory suppression (repeating a word) decreases performance. Also better impulse control. Inner speech seems to be used to both motivate and to evaluate behaviour. People who use inner speech more often also show more self-understanding. Inner speech often has to-and-fro quality of conversation.

Innocentive: [#Imagine122] Often, outsiders can solve a baffling problem, even while they would never have been hired by the industry because they were not qualified.

Innovating: [#Busa183] Malcolm Gladwell thinks that prodigies are good at learning/imitating, expert adults are much better at innovating, creating something new.

Innovation: [#Tigg57] Adoption of innovations depends on five factors: first, that the innovation has an important advantage on a point that matters, it must be compatible with existing values and behaviour, it is simple enough, it can be tried on small scale first, and when we can easily see the results/advantages. [#Hatt12] Innovation in education goes beyond the Hawthorne effect; it encourages teachers to pay more attention to what works, and what doesn't work. [#Syed90] Innovations in technique mean that suddenly everyone in the field can perform better and reach higher levels. [#NS18022012] Some innovations, to take hold, require both a sufficient number of people who can use it (facebook depending on internet), and may require the clout of a big company for some changes (apple being able to get MP3-rights from music companies). Also, price must be right (making a very high quality product that is just too expensive, like Xerox did, will be defeated by lower quality that is affordable to many], sufficient quality (Newton with poor handwriting recognition) and good enough technology (interactive TV much worse than internet). Also perceiving 'bad' behaviour and trying to squash it instead of seeing a need. {EW: 'they should not be doing this' ? 'they should be doing this, because...'} [#MedicinesOkt12] Regulatory instances have a hard role, innovation catch 22: if too strict, stifle innovation. If too lax, too many later failures, making the sector 'high risk', stifling funding. [http://marksblog.emc.com/2011/10/episode-109-innovation-and-the-importance-of-focus.html] Should usually be done by a small focused team, not by people 'hobbying' next to their regular work on the existing project. Also, need to be provided the resources of the large organization, but not to the level of bureaucracy that is appropriate to mature products. [#DeKrachtVanDeKatalysator] Collaboration between universities and companies does not yield much; the most important role of universities would be to educate innovative people. [#Hooked23] Consumers irrationally overvalue the old, companies irrationally overvalue the new; in reality, a product needs to be 9x as good as the old product to gain a foothold, especially if they require a large amount of behavioral change. [#http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/blogs/blog/how-does-your-company-stack-up-when-it-comes-to-innovation / https://www.fastcodesign.com/3069069/ideo-studied-innovation-in-100-companies-heres-what-it-found ] 6 rules: pursue multiple ideas (ideally 5 or more), people should not be afraid to speak up, unified vision and follow through on projects, leaders should be participative (also do work), remote working is good, people should touch base daily

Innovators: [#Hatt257] Teachers who most readily adopt innovations are those who are open to change, more educated, a greater store of knowledge, more self-confident, not so concerned with norms of others. In percentage, 85% resistant to change, 10% willing to become more efficient, 5% willing to try new innovations.

Input: [#Gold86] Asking input is extremely handy for leaders or scientists – a team is always smarter than even the smartest person (Rosalyn Franklin). Just let just the leader make the decision -team votes are horrible.

Inquiry-based teaching: [#Hatt209] Letting students observe, pose questions and experiment has a rather modest effect on content knowledge, but is quite good for teaching critical thinking (d=1.02) and helps attitude.

Insecurity: [#Burkem0] Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure – salvation and sanity consist in the most radical recognition that we have no way of saving ourselves.

Insights: [#Ster195] People feel gradually getting 'warmer'/closer to the solution on non-insight problems, but on insight problems, they do not feel any 'warning' in advance, certainly not far in advance. [#EW/Kluw] Would insight be the result of some neurons being activated, searching and at once locking in the correct cycle/pattern? [Simo42] Often animals only display insight if they have already learned the necessary components/pieces of the puzzle to string together. A chimpanzee may only reach the high banana if he has experimented with boxes first. [#Ster194] Verbalization disrupts problem-solving by insight. [#Strien25] Insight can cause a 'peak experience', a kind of cognitive orgasm. [#Catmul] While you can try to transfer insights with short mottos or explanations, it is kind of the suitcase-handle problem: delivering the handle without the suitcase (why it is true, and when, and when not) can be counterproductive if not dangerous. [#Stalla121] When we have an insight that constructs a mental map, we get high-frequency gamma waves and an increase in adrenalin that gives us a feeling of pleasure and boosts our energy level.

Insomnia: [#SciAmMindNov11] Insomnia can be eased with caps that use circulating water to cool the prefrontal cortex.

Inspiration: [#Howe185] Complex ideas and works of art, despite popular accounts, never seem to appear fully formed, but are formed slowly in parts and fragments. [#Bloo412] Sometimes, instead of a great first teacher, a child had a kind of enlightening experience that they wanted to play THAT great piece they heard. [#Robi100] If you are inspired, it's easier to inspire others {EW: inspiration = things are important} {EW: also based on #concepts known?} [#More82] Inspiration (as prelude to motivation) is asking why you want it, having a vision of what the skill could bring you. [EW: but asking for lots of reasons may be a bad idea; good idea might be to focus though on social extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation (mastery etc.) [#EdithRoefs] Inspiring teachers are those who surprise students, make them think. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201101/take-down-motivational-poster-it-may-make-you-give-sooner] Beware that inspirational stories aid people who are exhausted and have nigh given up, but demotivates people who have not exerted themselves yet, theory is that comparison hero-ordinary you is discouraging, comparison, failure who succeeded-failure encouraging. It may be better, in normal circumstances, to seek role models closer to home. [#Hargit117] For nobel laureates, inspiration usually came from book, chemistry set or other experimentation at home, teacher (especially hig school teacher). Also home environment, family members or family friend. Many developed it in early teenage years, some only after they took up medical school. Competitors: music and some humanties, balance tipped by taste for research and good mentor. Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif. Semenov was interested in chemistry, but read somewhere that the future of chemistry was in physics, so he decided to pursue that instead since he wanted to become a good chemist.

Instruction: [#EricB289] Young talents did not get overly much instruction, but did play around a lot in their talent area, reading about it, and talking/listening/watching others, demonstrating involvement both publicly and privately. [#Stol?] One mode of learning, next to training and education. While the end result of training is a perfect automatism that works subconsciously, the end result of instruction is always thoughtful action: the learner must find the basis for the rules and be able to generalize beyond what was taught, and adapt the knowledge to new conditions (if you're not prepared, you must improvise using what you know). Training, instruction and education seldom remain pure, but are commonly mixed [EW: training is reflexes, instruction=mental models, education=value systems].

Instructional architectures: [#Clar23] There are four instructional architectures, receptive, directive, guided discovery, and exploratory. Receptive: learners as sponges, few opportunities for overt engagement. Directive: learning baby steps, building up to something greater (tennis/musical instrument). Guided discovery: room for experimenting and error, scenarios. Exploratory: very open-ended, often learners set their own goals!

Insula: [#Nelissen189] Colours the feeling; benzodiazepines can 'alleviate' pain by making it less distressing. [#NS250114] anterior insula is involved in predicting how the body is going to feel in the next instant. Those are then compared to the actual sensations, generating a 'prediction error'. If the prediction error is small, we feel good. In some epilepsy attacks, the comparison does not work anymore, so 'everything seems to make sense'. The deeper the meditative state, the bigger the activity in the anterior insula.

Insula anterior: [#NRC130613] In depressed patients, if the insula anterior is less active than average, psychotherapy is more useful. If it is more active, antidepressnats work better.

Integrated network: [#Root] The best scientists have networks of activities that sustain each other, not compete against each other.

Integration: [#Medi201] The brain tries to reconcile different sensory inputs; an example is the McGurk effect, where visual “ga” and audible “ba” are interpreted as “da” [#Ster319/EW] Integration/unity is important in a domain, as a 'loose collection' of data (like pre-periodic table chemistry) hampers finding and communicating information, making it less clear whether or not something novel and useful has been produced. [#Csik169] Family integration stimulates affect (feeling good) as well as activation.

Intellectual blocks: [#Adams71] Wrong language (math, visual) inflexible or inadequate use of problem-solving stratgies; lack of information or incorrect information, inadequate skill to express and record ideas. [So choose strategy: math/verbal etc first?] Note that verbal thinking is fraught with glib generalities. You may think you have found the answer, while actually you have not. Next to language, you can also change strategies, Interaction Associates (Strategy Notebook) lists 66 of them. So you can at least be conscious of your strategy choice and experiment with that.

Intellectualization: [#Internet] People with Asperger tend to intellectualize a lot. {EW: why? Because they have trouble understanding the world? While normal people just absorb the status quo?} {or would they make explicit mental models since they can't automatically predict how people will behave?}

Intelligence: [#Grin] According to Darwin, intelligence is how well an organism adapts its behaviour to its environment; this is much broader than cognitive intelligence (which merely measures how well an organism adapts itself to the environment of a school). [#Ster261] Intelligence (when high-creativity/low intelligence persons are compared to low-creativity/high intelligence people) seems to be the ability to delay gratification and adapt oneself to the 'real world'. [#NS090711, Sian Beilock] More intelligence is not always good; have more working memory, but also tend to use more working-memory demanding algorithms, which results in more choking under stress. In addition, tend to over-think and analyze instead of going with the flow on auto-pilot. [#NS10092011] Intelligence may have to do with seeing patterns in data, 'compressing' them. [#EW] Intelligence seems to be related to reaction speed and to divergent clock cycle time; would it be the amount of brain space someone can search before returning with an answer?

Intentional learning: [#Wolt39] In contrast to incidental learning; intentional learning is not necessarily stronger than incidental learning, but has lower failure rate since the attention is fixed on the right stimulus, and people can choose an optimal strategy.

Intentions: [#Hatt32] Intentions explain about 28% of behaviour, and highest if the learner has actual control over the behaviours.

Interaction: [#SimonB142] The more eminent a scientist was, the more interactive links he had with fellow scientists. Controversies,competions, rivalries, more intimate relationships, and contacts with colleagues, correspondents and associates. Plus with not-so-eminent scientists.

Interactivity: [#Zill34] Better educated subjects, with higher cognitive capacities, seem to enjoy interactive media more, if the cognitive capacities are lower, people seem sooner overwhelmed or stressed. [#Zill203] Whereas movies depend on strong input to create arousal, video games can even work with less strong and realistic input, as interactivity is very arousing as well.

Interdependence: [#Nass92] Interdependence is achieved under two conditions: people must belive that reaching the team goal will also help them reach their personal goal, and they must believe that their efforts and those of other team members are integral to the success of the team.

Interference: [#Wolt52] If a cue is most strongly linked to another concept, interference occurs and we seem to have forgotten the originally learned item. [#Nati39] If related words are learned in a set (similar/opposite/related meanings, similar sounds, similar grammatical function) interference occurs, making learning more difficult. However, if not learned in sets, previous knowledge can help learn new words more easily. [#http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm] Interference can be lessened if the two interfering items are learned together and distinguishing them: disgustingly humble ?...[ cringing] prevents confusion between humble and cringing. [#Higbee34] Proactive inhibition if earlier memories inhibit later memories, retroactive inhibition if the other thing takes place.

Interindividual differences: [#EW] Interindividual differences do exist, but do they make or break a career? [#http://www.intermediair.nl/magazine/20150219/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2015wk08&utm_campaign=iw&e=1&m_i=3Fu3qXpxIPyeN4P6BSdRG5zsbSwjJFgFHC_HWuIJ99Ti1kJN_e_dZR1Hu9aQhj6TD4eCmtJtA%2BtXqerahKbxbY4kYZ9pl#7] People asking for your time may need different treatments: those who tend to doubt and worry need to be provided with a method for making decisions (10 advantages, 10 disadvantages), talkative people need to be delegated to the coffee breaks, professorial types need to be asked what they want exactly and when they want it, and 'dominant extraverts' need to be be praised and told off politely.

Interindividual differences (in learning): [#EricB151] If a skill can be obtained by nearly everyone, the interindividual differences tend to decrease, as there is much more variation in starting levels than there is at the top levels (a few strokes in golf). The inverse is called the Matthew effect, where people who perform less well, initially, drop out.

Intermediate steps: [#Tigg178] Intermediate steps and their rewards can greatly help the change process; ideal duration is some days to a week. [#Will113] Intermediate steps make problem-solving much more difficult; knowledge of small facts (like 6+9=15) moves such an intermediate step out of working memory and into simple fetch-retrieval, making it much more likely that a solution is found. Memorizing maths facts helps maths tasks!

Internal evaluation: [#Stalla53] Wooden: succes is the peace of mind that comes from knowing you gave your very best efforts in every practice and every game rather than focusing on anything outside your control.

Internal obstacles: [#Weng181] Often there are internal obstacles holding you back from achieving your goals, acting as a sort of 'inner brake'; so it may be useful to remove those first!

Internalisation: [#Frabzeb196] How much a goal is internalized. If only the method is internalized (' following the book') it's called introjection – do because you have to. Accepting the goals/social norms is called identification, finally, harmonizing the goals with the core concept of self is called integration. Is helped by positive 'waardering' by important others with which the person feels connected, if you like your teacher, you're more likely to internalize school rules.

Internalizing knowledge: [#Greene260] Trying to make knowledge one's own by finding ways to put it to practical use, look for connections between the various elements we are learning.

Internals: [#Hatt48] Students who take on personal responsibility for life events; good for academic achievement. Greater for adolescents and males than for females, children and adults.

International Society for the Psychology of Science and Technology: investigate!

International Telementor Program: [#Robi183] A program that links students to professionals electronically.

Internet addiction: May shrink our brains?

Interoception: [#NS040513] Being able to count your heartbeat without taking your pulse. Interoception makes you more intuitive, better at remembering emotional information. Low interoception linked with depression. [#NS060517FeelingYourHeartbeatHelpsReadOthersMinds] Higher interoception – better at recognizing emotions others, though not other’s thoughts

Interpersonal skills: [#Medsker, Acquisition of interpersonal communication skills: a research-based approach] For interpersonal communcation skills, traditional lecture-based methods don't help; they are about too general situations and don't show or let the workshoppee experience the process. Ideally, in advance you seek out highly competent performers and study how they handle a situation, extract 'critical steps', give those as theory in the workshop, then show video of competent performer doing that [preferably also showing the positive result], then class discusses what performer did to do critical steps and how those were implemented. Then skill-practices of increasing difficulty, participants being asked to plan for contingencies. During practice, instructor and other participants take notes, finally give specific and positive feedback, in the form of APB: alternative and positive behaviours.

Interrogating: [#Sommers10] Interrogators of supected terrorists in Iraq failed as long as they saw the Iraqi prisoners as incorrigble evildoers, and started working when they started using cultural respect and rapport building (+distortions of reality, false hope, and lies)

Interrogative self-talk: [#SellHuman101] Asked by Bob the Builder 'Can we fix it?' - asking questions of yourself works better that affirmative statements ('I can do it'). May work because mind offers strategies, or because it could inspire thoughts about intrinsic motivation. Do it in writing {EW: reference?}

Interview method: [http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2012/12/05/interview-method/ ] one way to find out how to succeed in a field and whether you really need a degree is to interview 5 moderately successful people in the field and ask for their observations over the years [EW: of course, most people don't know the secrets of their own success, but you'll be way ahead of the pack]

Intrapersonal intelligence: [#Ster218] Needed to distinguish ideas that one wants to be good from ideas that are really good {?}

Intrinsic (Reward): Doing something because you enjoy doing it. Many things that are intrinsically rewarding are biologically sensible, such as good food, sex, learning new and important things. However, it is possible to couple nearly everything, even chores, to intrinsic rewards; for example you can congratulate yourself and get a feeling of accomplishment if you finally fixed that broken chair. Contrast to extrinsic reward. [#Whit25] <EW: perhaps a sense of accomplishment and meaningfulness could also be counted with the intrinsic rewards> [#Scho54] Driving a car and enjoying it can be better than just using the car to get from A to B and getting frustrated over every obstacle. [EW: we tend to fuss over the fact that we are not 'there' yet, even though that's a recipe for unhappiness]

Intrinsic motivation: [#Colv188] High creative achievement and intrinsic motivation seem to be related. Intrinsic motivation here means focusing on the problem rather than what it can do for you. In entrepreneurs it is the need for achievement, need for power, or even the need to do good in the world. Competition may also help (Watson & Crick vs Pauling) At some point, the drive may switch from extrinsic to intrinsic (young man with piano lessons hearing a really great pianist) [#Bloo526] Transition from extrinsic to intrinsic may also be more gradual and natural, as one starts to identify oneself with the field. [#EW] Looking at musicians, being intrinsically motivated in a field does not however mean that you'll find all activities in it (such as practice) enjoyable or effortless. [#EW] “A reward a day makes work out of play” may only count if the reward is very much linked to the performance, or when the autonomy of the performance (so fun) is diminished by externally imposed goals. [#Ster301] It seems that just thinking about intrinsic reasons to do something may already be sufficient to increase intrinsic motivation! [#Csik140] Intrinsic motivation is correlated to affect as well as performance (though only 0,2-0,5 correlations) {some scientists argue that intrinsic/extrinsic boundary is badly defined, perhaps illusory!} [#Franzen195] The conditions for high intrinsic motivation are: 1) being free in the choice of goals, 2) find the goals meaningful, 3) feel challenged by the goals, 4) feel as if the goals are in reach, 5) feel in control over the way to the goals, 6) get feedback on intermediate performance, 7) can ascribe results to their own competences and efforts 8) are not dependent of external circumstances. [#PinkDrive106] People high in intrinsic motivation are better coworkers. [#Ryan2000] Animals spontaneously engage in exploratory, playful behaviour, even if it does not seem to give an immediate reward. It seems intrinsically pleasurable to human beings to be interested in novelty, in learning things, and in creatively applying our skills. Debate in psychology whether activities aer intrinsically rewarding (what makes an activity motivating) or whether intrinsic motivation depends on the needs of the person itself. So basically, intrinsic motivation may just exist on the nexus between person and activity. Intrinsic motivation may be enhanced by feelings of competence. Therefore, optimal challenges, effectance promoting feedback, and freedom from demeaning evaluations should help. Cognitive Evaluation Theory also states that feelings of competence will only enhance intrinsic motivation by a sense of autonomy/internal perceived locus of causality. Intrinsic motivation decreased by threats, deadlines, directives, and competition pressure. Choice and opportunity for self-direction help. Novelty, challenge, aesthetic value. The more internalized motivation becomes (linked to sense of self) the more persistence, positive self-perceptions, and better quality of engagement. In principle, people can shift their motivation forwards and backwards (or motivation can be shifted forwards and backwards through good/bad mentoring). Introjected regulation gives more effort than amotivation, but also more anxiety and poorer coping styles. Greater relatedness to teachers and parents associated to greater internalizatiojn of school-related behavioral regulations. Meaningful rationale for uninteresting behavior, along with supports for autonomy and relatedness, promotes internalization and integration. [#HaidtH110] Monkeys also like to solve puzzles, even if they do not get any rewards out of it.

Introverts: [#Eyse157] Tend to have high and rigid aspirations, and are not always above fraud to

Intuition: [#Root03] Fermi had a highly developed intuition for what proofs were 'correct' and incorrect, and was often right. {EW: would this be the mysterious 'wisdom' of top scientists, due to deliberate practice having a vastly broader and better understanding of nature?} [#Eyse177] Intuition can be false however! Intuition may be mentally 'jumping to conclusions' on the basis of inadequate data but great knowledge. Successful intuitive thinkers seem more interested in abstractions than in persons {perhaps because the test was abstract?}. Anyway, intuitive thinking seems related to creativity. [#Robi186/EW] Intuition may work on scraps of data that we have gathered subconsciously. [#Ster68] Intuition may be a kind of preconscious knowledge of a solution. Guessing students often had a guess that was close to the true solution, suggesting their subconscious had (almost?) solved the problem, yet the solution had not yet made it to consciousness. [#Rost104] Eminent artists/scientist score higher on intuition on the Westcott test (how many cues are needed to detect the pattern). [#Wise79] Intuition is often just pattern recognition, you've seen people like that before, mixed with the familiarity effect which makes us prefer things we have once seen and vaguely remember subconsciously. [#Foer51] Chicken sexers just 'know' the sex of a chicken – would this be comparable with scientific intuition? {EW: no, as problem finders really think longer; since they had better intuition – needed fewer cues, may have had better ability to calm their brain instead} [#Ns050916HowDoBicylesStayUpright?] Intuitively, human riders steer bicycles at low speeds by wobbling their knees. So unconsciously we have learned to do that.

Inventing: [#EricB561] Many calculators (next to obtaining algorithms from books) invented their own.

Inventions: [#Howe178] Inventions almost never spring out of nothing, but are inspired by (and improving on) earlier machines and developments.

Inverse depression: [#Syed164] Top sportspeople are able to filter out all negatives in a situation and totally focus on what they have done well, 'taking the positives'. This way they can maintain an exaggerated self-belief. Note that they of course must learn from their mistakes, there is a 'performance cycle' in which they must focus on the negatives and improving upon them when training, but then build up tremendous-self-belief again before and during a match. So sportspeople, like depressed people (and, probably, average people), have an incredible ability to be irrational.

Inverse genius: [#SimonB34] Some people become famous for making horrid works [like William MacGonagall]. Are they true geniuses? In any case they master a specific niche...

Inverse question: [#Newportxviii] Inverting the question can yield interesting answers; instead of asking “how to do I find my passion” - how do people end up loving what they do?

Investment: [#Myst31] The more a girl has invested in you, the less willing she is to give up on that <Sunk costs? Or assuming that you MUST be valuable because of that?>. Investments can be emotional (being emotional around a man), physical investment (kissing), time, money, and whether she is putting in effort herself, such as chasing you. [#Lieb55] Investing in yourself is the best way to get a better mood <since you're acting as if you are worthwhile?>. [#GiftednessMusicPres] Investment of effort depends on whether learning is interesting, important, useful, difficult; also on confidence and competence. [#Hooked144] Ask for investment _after_ the variable reward, especially as you then also get the reciprocation effect. Smart request for investment is to load the next trigger/ make user create next trigger for engagement. As for rational investment: our tools also store value: content, data, (+ better customization?), followers, reputation, skill (things get easier to use over time). [#Schmid223] Overinvestment is dangerous for new ideas, as people are more reluctant then to kill them later on. And keeping things simple and cheap in the beginning can encourage innovation (Google Book started with Larry Page scanning a book with a camera and metronome)

Investment effect: [#Hooked] Origami-example, the IKEA-effect, we appreciate something more the more time and effort we have spent on it. [Let girl invest a little in you as per the juggler method?]

Investment theory: [#Ster11] Creativity requires six distinct but interrelated resources: intellectual abilities, knowledge, style of thinking, personality, motivation, and environment. Intellectual is synthetic (thinking up new ideas), analytic (evaluating and improving them) and practical-contextual (marketing them). Environment means support, a forum to display ones ideas, people to encourage you. Personality: some risk taking, stubbornness. Motivation: intrinsic may be best (love what you are doing).

Involvement: [#Csik120] Arts show high integration/low differentation, sciences the reverse. This means that arts classes are mostly enjoyable, but seldom challenging; science classes show the reverse. Arts classes have high involvement at the cost of doing things that are not very important for skill building; science classes do important things which are often boring.

Inze, Dirk: [#C2W100911] Winner FWO-prize, explains success not from better intelligence, but from working very hard, thinking continuously about research, had the luck to get into a good group, has also promoted their work everywhere, also always sought collaborations. To get new ideas, reads a great deal and mingles in scientific debate.

Ipad: [#NS290314Screens are not all bad, the iPad is today's novel] Ipads increase cooperation and help quieter kids speak up. Print + touchscreen is better than only print, especially for kids from low SES

IQ: [#EW] It is unclear what the role is of the intelligence quotient (IQ) in genius. It has been proven that IQ does not need to be astronomically high to achieve high honors (there are at least two Nobel prize winners with childhood IQs below 140), but scientists are still unsure whether the minimum IQ for very high achievement would be like 100, 110, 120 or 130. 130 seems to be a rather safe 'lower bound', though in fact 115 may be enough according to some (don't know the primary literature on that). The physiological mechanism of IQ is also unclear; it may be that IQ is related to the ratio of time that the brain spends in a disorganized state versus an organized state, however not all brain regions seem to have a similar 'clock', and cultural knowledge also affects IQ considerably; having many nerve cells/pathways dedicated to solving specific problems can cheat IQ tests. That is also why psychologists try to distinguish between 'pure' intelligence and 'learned' intelligence, though that is quite hard. [#Root] Top scientists don't seem to differ much in IQ (if at all) from average scientists, and have as broad ranges of personalities.	[#Colv45] High IQ helps with doing an unfamiliar task, but doesn't seem to affect learning speed nor affect final performance (a bit if anything). [#Eyse1] IQ seems to be sum of general factor and independent contributions of different abilities. Is seen as related to abstract thinking, problem solving, and acquiring knowledge. [#Ster28] Above an IQ of 115, creativity and IQ are more or less independent abilities after late childhood. [#Wiki] Musical training can raise IQ, training ones working memory possibly too. Heritabilty of IQ increases with age to about 0,75 for adults {EW: different brain maturation rates, or do IQ-tests profit from knowledge of which all people have enough when reaching adulthood?}; adoptive siblings have as much IQ correlation as strangers (0.0!) IQ in impoverished families is over 0.6 determined by the shared environment and not by genetics! Shared maternal/fetal environments may be larger than previously thought, 5-20% for siblings/twins [though this is disputed!]. Would the positive feedback loops caused by higher IQ only continue as long as people are stimulated, and lack of stimulation in adulthood diminish the effect? {EW: and would IQs of genius children be overestimated due to very stimulating parental environments?} Higher IQ correlates with more grey matter in the lateral prefrontal cortex. The CHRM2-gene also seems to influence intelligence. And neural plasticity? In any case, intelligence may be changeable. Depression decreases IQ. [higher IQ: bigger chance vegetarian, smaller chance smoking, lower prevalence schizophrenia] Inherited wealth, race and schooling are more significant for later income than IQ (which explains about 25%) [LIT: EricB10 IQ in chess/science] EricB10: “Measures of basic mental capacities are not valid predictors of attainment of expert performance in a domain” [EW] Een IQ-test is alleen een ranking, Gaussiaans gebaseerd. Het betekent niet zoiets dat iemand met een IQ van 120 twee keer zo snel denkt als iemand met een IQ van 60 (of twee keer zoveel weet). Het kan 0,2% meer zijn, of juist 200x meer! [#EricB155] IQ has high validity in predicting academic performance; however it predicts ones subsequent career less well. [#Rost107] did not find significant differences on verbal comprehension, logical reasoning and visio-spatial skills between acclaimed and normal scientists and artists, suggesting that IQ doesn't matter that much (though all subjects seemed to have quite high IQ). [#EW] Would historical IQs be overestimated since they measure gc, which is probably correlated very much to curiosity? [#EricB590] The eight factors of intelligence are positively correlated, but independent (cannot predict one factor when knowing the other seven). [#Wagn1236] IQ explains about 4% of performance in an occupation. Difference may be that the most important question in work is how to reach ones short-term and long-term goals; IQ puzzles don't suppose a real goal. [#Grin] IQ used to be mental age divided by real age (hence 'quotient' in its name). Was designed to find need for extra schooling -so it's not weird it correlates to scholastic success... Correlates modestly with school success – 0,4-0,6 (so 16-36%). [#Mehr142] Children with higher IQs are more task-oriented and less distractable. {EW: dopamine?} The greater task-orientation may produce more productivity at work. [#?] People with higher IQs live longer – that may not be because they are smarter, but because IQ correlates with general physiological health and decay; someone whose systems are failing will also have a lower IQ {EW: and note that intelligence can therefore be a prime characteristic for sexual selection, just like attractiveness!} [#Ster259] The Cox study, when reanalyzed by Simonton (and controlled for birth year) found no correlation between IQ and eminence {though all estimated IQs were extremely high; may be the area of grossly diminishing returns}. [#Csik208] Intelligence (as approximated by PSAT) has some relationship to teacher scores and grades in maths and sciences, but not to student's own perceived commitment. [#EW] Would Novel Scholastic Situation Performance Score be a better name? [#Simo3] A high IQ does not ensure exceptional talent or achievement beyond the ability to score high on standardized tests. Note that no well-known creator seems to have had below-average intelligence, but the exact location of the treshold is unknown. Note that extremely high IQs may not produce eminence by themselves. Iqs are related to real world success with a correlation between 4% and 25% [#Pers142] [#http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/04/19/1018601108.abstract?sid=573ca994-8b61-4d2a-a7e3-d79fd9f8a390] IQ tests may show spurious correlation with life success (except possibly academic success) as IQ scores increase with motivation (SD=0.64), especially for low-IQ kids. Motivation may be the real mediating factor. [#Outliers79] Arthur Jensen distinguishes 4 tresholds: not being able to go to a normal school (IQ 50), not being able to finish primary school (75), not being able to succeed in academic preparation in highschool (105), or not being able to survive university (115). Above that, above 120, no measurable real-world advantage. [#NRC06012012] Children from lower SES adopted by higher SES parents gain 12-18 points in IQ; school similarly improves IQ. [#Ig and the wealth of nations]: better education increases IQ of lesser intelligent pupils. [#Int281011] Terman's 'A' children were more vivacious and more motivated and 'betrokkener'/engaged than 'C'-children (but social environment?). Also more willpower, perseverance and competitiveness. More classes skipped, more out-of school activities like sports. Lianne Hoogeveen: got her PhD on showing that skipping grades is good for the gifted. [#NS080912] Chinese perform 7 points better than their IQ would predict; like women, Chinese are more adjusted to formal education (culture or genes?): don't skip class, had homework in on time, don't get suspended. (Flynn also wrote book 'Asian Americans'. Asian parents are over the moon, not just 'perfunctory praise', when child comes home with high grades)> [#NS010912] IQ may be decreased by cannabis, especially if cannabis is used before 18th birthday. [#Flourish108] IQ does not correlate much to reaction time per se, but it does correlate to choice reaction time ('press right button when light is green, left if light is red'). [#Zagorsky'Do you have to be smart to be rich?'490] The average IQ of a country and GDP have an exponential relationship (so not linear) [#Intelligence and socioeconomic success: A meta-analytic review of longitudinal research Tarmo Strenze] Read it – but IQ does not seem to predict much above SES and grades. [#Strien45] Mensa, four sigma, prometheus society and mega society for highest Iqs. Having the potential for great achievements [well, barring self-discipline and such] seems taken as a sort of nice token instead of real achievement. The urge to distinguish oneself seems unbeatable.. [#NS070913] Older brothers have a 2.3 point IQ advantage over their younger brothers, but if the older brother dies, the younger brother has an higher IQ than average – the social status seems to be the determining factor, at least more than true age of parents and suich [#NS080613] Philipp Koellinger. SNPs can explain only 2-3% of variation in educational achiement – they expected at least 20%. Possibilities: non-SNP variations, effect of SES on educational attainment, non-linear effects, epigenetics, many more SNPs that have too weak effects to notice in just 126000 people. Even though 2.5 million SNPs account for half the heritability in height. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/science-environment-15369851] IQ can change from 14 to 18 years of age; verbal IQ correlated to density left motor cortex, non-verbal IQ to density of anterior cerebellum (movement of hand) [#Seligm108] IQ correlates very well with intelligent choice reaction, but not with simple reaction time. [#NS040715TheBenefitsOfADiverseBackground] IQ(cognitive ability) is higher (as is height, lung function, and educational attainment) if children have parents that are less related [#Markus4] Performance on Raven Progressive Matrices increases in order: Asian think aloud < European silent < European talking < Asian silent. [EW: how to explain this? Motivation vs optimal arousal?]

Irrationality: [#EW] Irrationality originates from two factors: 1) the brain can probably through biological constraints never be a perfect reasoning machine, 2) the brain needs to have 'shortcuts' and rules of thumb to address 'natural' situations with lack of information better, but will handicap it in non-natural situations (TANSTAAFL theorem). [#Pers116] Often people seem irrational because other goals (for example, preventing loss of face) override their main goals. [#EW] These other goals may be more important goals (making money vs serving the public), more short-term enjoyable goals (avoiding doing the dishes) or habits acted upon without thought. Finally, people may make a wrong decision because they have the wrong information, and THINK they're moving towards a goal while actually moving away from it. Would this be related to goodness (having right goal), guts (doing the more difficult or unpleasant thing if it is the right thing to do) or knowledge (knowing how to achieve the goal?) Besides, the human brain has built-in disbalances which prevent pure instinctual rationality (for example, the loss aversion bias).

Irritable babies: [#Redirect105] Irritableness in babies can be reduced by training the mother to make eye contact with their babies and to coo at them when the babies held their gaze, but to be silent when the babies looked away.

Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC): [#NS210712] Wearing a pressure cuff over one of your upper arms and inflating/deflating it 3 times for periods of five minutes not only diminishes damage after a suspected heart attack, it also helps athletes to perform better.

ISI: [#Kluw4] InterStimulus Interval; learning proceeds best when there is a specific interval between conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus; though the optimal ISI depends on the kind of association that has to be learned, the number of reinforced to non-reinforced trials, the difficulty of the association, and 'gradients of inhibitory and excitatory strength along the time axis'. Possibly the CS 'resonates' a while in the brain, first strengthening, then decaying, and the strength at the point of the US determining how well the learning takes place?

ISLS: [#tip van Jordan Lippmann:kijk daar eens! (misschien baanideeen?)]

Isolation: [#Crop20] Newton's most productive years were the two in which the university was closed, and he could continue his own studies at Woolthorpe. [#EW] But isolation in his  mountain villa did not help Hitler, and professors who are isolated from experiments are bad leaders...

Iterative improvement: [#Coyl142] Like at KIPP, each year throwing out ideas that do not work and trying out new ideas.

Jackson, Michael: [#Wiki<-HadassahDeBoer] Father (Joe Jackson) performed with a R&B band. Pummeled Michael, abused him emotionally and physically, drilled him in music. Michael described him also though as a genius who instilled him with the necessary discipline. {EW: note that Michael was eigth of ten children, Janet last. Father had practiced on his elder kids; the Polgar syndrome}

James Bond: James Bond is a fictional figure, an employee of the British Secret Service, with a “license to kill”. He was first made famous in books, later in films. One of the interesting things about James Bond is the contrast between exterior (lounge lizard) and his true character (a sharp-witted brave fighter). James Bond, as portrayed in the movies, consistently demonstrates high value (DHV) and is therefore quite a hit with girls, both fictional and real. He is good-looking, calm/cool, generative, quick-witted and strong, with a well-groomed exterior and a sense of humour.He does not show uncertainty by bragging, he is convinced of his own charm and rejections are taken with humor and good cheer. [interesting question when you are dating: how would James Bond take the rejection?]

James, William: [#Strien327] Had really dominant, Calvinistic grandfather, migrating from North Ireland to build a financial empire in the US, disinherited his 'rebellious' son Henry. However, Henry disputed the will successfully, being able to live the life of a free intellectual and truth seeker, and could spend lots of time educating his children, shuttling the family back and forth from the VS to Europe. William had lots of depressions and traveled a lot for Kurs, but (like his father) made links to prominent scientists all over the world. Got more stable after marrying a strong woman.

Jazz musicians: [#Ster236] Though improvisation is the core of jazz, even eminent jazz musicians learn their metier by learning to play the works of the great musicians by heart, note by note. Johnson-Laird made a model of jazz improvisation, but at the moment it seems that jazz musicians have a certain repertoire out of which they pick the right 'note chunks' from memory. {EW: may also explain their individual style} [#Seth66] While both jazz musicians and classical musicians undergo disciplined training, the training of jazz musicians is explicitly directed at creativity and improvisation. Would normal scientist training be like that of classical musicians, Sommerfeld's one being like jazz musicians?

Jealousy: [#White24] Jealousy can be an extremely useful tool for learning what you want, but you have to admit that you are jealous first; which can sometimes be perceived by either ascribing the other's success to luck, connections, or doubtful behaviour, or that your relationship with that person changes. Note that you won't always want exactly what the other wants, but you may want an aspect of it (like adventure or more autonomy) + pay more attention to others/place yourself in their shoes to get ideas.

Jetlag: [#NRC051013] Mice without vasopressin receptors easily adjust to a new day-night rhythm – in 1 day instead of 6.

Jews: [#Hargit37] There are over 116 Jewish Nobel laureates, possibly because Jewish culture values learning; however, there are relatively few Israeli laureates [EW: no 2-cultures] Other explanation: family tradition, devoition to education, drive for success, and some healthy insecurity that propels you to work hard. Note that many Jewish laureates came from Eastern europe, which was notoriously politically unstable.

Job: [#Newport56] Only avoid jobs (since they are not conductive to the craftsman mindset) where you have few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing skills that are rare and valuable, which you consider useless or detrimental to the world, or where you really dislike your colleagues.

Job enrichment: [#Pers138] Branch of psychology that tries to find out what really motivates people to work hard and well, and how to make people work well.

Job interviews: [#NS060413] It should be possible to fake a confident walk (even though your walk has nothing to do with your real personality). People in job interviews who sit still, hold eye contact, smile and nod along with the conversation are more likey to be offered a job. Don't let gaze wander, don't avoid eye contact, don't keep your head stll. Not changing your expression much is also a bad way to get accepted. [#http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1] Zero correlation with job success, unless you are a great expert in a subfield and only interview for that; structured interviews, especially when asking for a difficult situation in the past and how they solved it, are much better. Brainteasers are a waste of time, GPAs almost a waste of time (except when people are fresh out of college)

Job satisfaction: [#DeMoor26] Job satisfaction by itself does not increase the quantity or quality of work, job dissatisfaction, however, is correlated to absence, coming late and turnover. Job satisfaction is quite back-looking: am I content? Am I treated fairly; this in contrast to job motivation: what do I want to achieve? Seems mostly related to extrinsic rewards, and 'compliance' (while labor motivation has to do with engagement). Job satisfaction may however be necessary for engagement; jobs must reward people 'equitably'. [#NS220616Don'tGiveUpTheDayJob] 6 factors: authenticity – you are accessing your 'true self' – following a calling or can be yourself. Agencu: able to make significant decisions and feel yu make a difference. Self-worth – work makes you feel valuable. Purpose: work makes you feel closer to a strongly-held goal. Belonging: colleagues. Transcendence: sacrifice for a greater cause.

job-person fit: [#Mike]

Jobs: [#Csik245] Research suggests that teenage jobs have little positive effect on developmental outcomes. [#NS191209] The longer a person stays at a particular level in an organisation, the more most measures of their performance fall [EW: but is this per person, or averages? Otherwise the competents would be 'promoted away', skewing the average] [#Flourish75] Job: you do it for the money. Money stops, job stops. Career: you do it for the promotions. When the promotions stop, you quit or become a time-serving husk. A calling you would do anyway. [#C2W181013; Vakbond voor de wetenschap] 59% of people with a PhD working at Dutch universities have a permanent contract, in 1995 that was 78%. [#NS?] 6 factors can give meaning to a job, though personality and culture may influence what we find meaning in. [#Schmid136] Choose industry first, then find smart people to work for (the Steve Jobses, people brimming with initiative and insights). Make the ideal job a stretch, not a gimme. Read about your company and business. Elevator pitch: what can you say that noone else can?

Jobs, Steve: [#Isaacson357] Fought the forces of ugliness and evil. Also had a 'reality distortion field', which however did not always work on a large scale (getting dozens of people to meet a deadline) [#Catmul143] Was known to change his mind instantly in the light of new facts. [#305] Threw ideas up in the air just to see if it would work, if he should become its advocate. Otherwise, he moved on.

Johari Window: [#MikeBeyerlein] (un)Known to self x (un)known to others: open self, blind self, hidden self, unknown self.

Jokes: [#NS16062012] People who have just listened to jokes are better at solving mental puzzles.

Joule, James: [#Crop59] James Joule worked in his family's brewery and did most of his research in the early morning and evening. Had no university education, and hardly any training at all in science. Also lived in a scientific 'hinterland'. First papers were just received in silence, as Joule used so many new concepts, ideas and methods that nobody could properly understand them. Worked together with instrument maker when he needed more accurate thermometers than any of his contemporaries. Was described as somewhat nervous and having not much grace or facility of speech. Was infinitely patient as experimenter, but fulminating against political liberals. Never very assertive or self-confident (though was in his papers; intellectual equality). But had unparallelled experimental skill, independence and inspiration. Perfectly conceived experiments, not by making lots of groping errors first. However, had ample independent income when young. Dalton was an example to him: self-taught, living and practicing in Manchester, yet world famous. And his teacher, stressing the importance of accurate measurements. Was inspired since he saw finding nature's laws as essentially a holy undertaking {so important!}.

Journal club: [#Osler] Club in which a group of people critically discusses the good points and weaknesses of a scientific paper. First official one was established by William Osler. [#Watt60] Can also extend to books, or by letting people read different books and discuss them. [#Mill68] Also formed by Mill (though more a book discussion club in his case). [#Hargit153] Cohen was helped by Arthur Kornberg's journal club.

Journalling: [#Watt56] Noting down your most poignant observations for later study, reflection and reference is useful.[#ArnoI] Keeping a journal is much better than keeping a diary: not your ego, but your observations about life.[#http://www.intermediair.nl/artikel/competenties-en-vaardigheden/290372/zo-houd-je-lol-in-je-werk-zonder-van-baan-te-veranderen.html?&utm_campaign=redactiemailing&utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Week482011] It may be useful to daily jot down what you've learned. [#Kiefer] Every day, review the previous day's journal; every week the previous week; every month the previous month, every year the previous year [EW: previous day is probably overdone; previous week/month/3 months is probably better, especially if you summarize highlights when going through] [#CoyleT12] Many high performers have some kind of daily performance journal, also for new ideas.

Joy: [#Nelissen74] Joy may increase learning. Sharing joy may also increase bonding. Baby's smiling is ideal to increase bonding with its parents.

Judgement: [#EW/Ster326] Some fields are easier to judge objectively than others (many former Nobel Prize winners in literature are nowadays not considered to be very creative or important, in contrast to the science laureates) and contemporaries are notoriously poor judges (van Gogh, Mozart). [#Ster333] Great scientist/inventors/whatever develop judgment, they know which ideas to throw away. [#Greene203] While as apprentice it is wise to have a Master evaluate your work, don't let the public do it (even though you should not ignore them) [#Strien219] The anticipated judgment of others is not only faced at the end of the research process, it is weaved through the decisions which experiments to perform.

Judging quality: [#EW] Most laypersons cannot discriminate between regional top performance and world performance, one can only perceive the differences if you are an expert yourself in the field. With Toastmasters, the general goal is to amuse or convince the audience, for which increasing skill above a certain treshold has barely any appreciable effect.

Juggling ideas: [#Medawar6] If you only have one project, you tend to persevere too long, have 'more strings on your bow', and be willing to take 'no' for an answer if evidence points that way.

Jung, Carl: [#Greene109] Started corresponding with Freud at age 31.

Juries: [#NRC190209? “De laatsten zijn bovengemiddeld vaak de eersten/Wändi Bruine”. If options distinguish themselves from each other by unique, positive properties, persons prefer the last option. If distinguished by unique, negative properties the first one. It does not matter if jurors judge each contestant simultaneously or after each other.

Just this one time: [#Lieb98] When changing people, ask them to try the new behaviour just one time, they can always revert later.

Justice: [#HaidtH171] Children believe in immanent justice, that if they break a rule, even if it is accidental and nobody else knows about it, they will be punished.

Juvenile delinquents: [#NRC050711] Juvenile delinquents improve their behaviour best when they feel supported by their group leader, have the idea that they are learning something, are not oppressed by many rules, and trust each other. This increases their feeling of control and makes them more willing to be treated/train.

Kaggle: [#NS011212] Organizes contests for money prizes, to make predictions (often better than experts do). Interestingly, top competitors are teaming up more and more with each other. Successful: random forests. Good participants know what to abstract from the data, winners tend to be curious and creative people, coming up with a dozen new ways to think about the problem (for the rest it is trial-and-error, though). Experts are useful when trying to find out what problem you should be solving.

Kaizen: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen] Philosophy of continuous improvement, letting people from assembly line to direction participate. Encourages people to use the scientific method in their work, and eliminating waste and overly hard work (muri). Asks the 5 whys and works in a cycle of standardizing, measuring, improving, ad infinitum.

Kapitsa: [#Hargit46] Nobel-prize winning Russian physicist, rare (like Pavlov) in standing up and criticizing the regime. [#Hargit115] He himself also behaved somewhat autocratically, though; staff respected but also feared him. [#137] In his institue, had the work stopped at a certain hour in the evening to let research workers have time to reflect. His workers had to take a break, whether they wanted to or not. (modeled after Rutherford's method of running the Cambridge). Also insisted on knowing everything that went on in his institute.

Karma: [#Pau] Focusing on others, doing the right thing, will also help you get good results and help your dreams come true {EW: more social capital, and self-like?}

Karplus, Martin: [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2013/nobelprijswinnaar-martin-karplus-aimabel-maar-keihard-in-de-wetenschap.html?utm_source=131015-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=nobelprijswinnaar-martin-karplus-aimabel-maar-keihard-in-de-wetenschap&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Promotor Hermen van Vlijmen, kon zeer kritische vragen stellen bij lezingen [EW: dus dacht diep door of maakte veel connecties? Groot werkgeheugen? Of gewoon patroonherkenning?] Was 'slow but thorough', was not satisfied until the calculations were entirely correct. No high speed of publications, but had high quality. Als mens was Karplus wat afstandelijk maar ook zachtaardig, vriendelijk en aardig. Zo organiseerde hij regelmatig een feestje voor zijn mensen, dat vond hij ook belangrijk. Was able to bring together scientists of different disciplines to get the job done.

Kasparov: [#Syed37] Kasparov was hot-tempered and eccentric {EW: neurotic/autistic? In any case passionate. No gentle genius, meek and mild}

Keats, John: [#Greene79] Lost father at age 8, mother at age 15. Loved reading, went to school and library in off-hours. Read works of greatest poets, tried to imitate their style, though always tweaking them a little with his own voice. Forced himself to write 4000 lines in 7 months, which trained him to be able to work through his writer's block and showed him weaknesses in his work (his floral language)

Kekule: [#Strien37] Was first trained as architect.

Keller's personalized system of instruction: [#Hatt171] Almost as effective as mastery learning, Keller's system is mainly text- and computer-based, teacher are more for tutorial support and providing motivation. Study time similar, but students got higher motivation and higher grades.

Kepler: [#Crop29] Started out as the assistant of Tycho Brahe(!) {mentors?} [#Hargit83] Had both exuberance and anguish while seeking the planetary model, and recorded them (journal). [#Strien99] Lived in tumultous times of reformation and contra-reformation, miserable youth, remained a onrustig, tormented and socially unrooted person. Was a protestant and therefore needed to change towns regularly. Also constant financial uncertainty (favor of lords). May have longed for heavenly order as compensation for chaos and uncertainty in his existence. [#115] In correspondence with other European scholars, but also rivalry -could not access Brahe's data until Brahe's death, and then only while fighting Brahe's family. Was not as socially skilled as Galilei and such. [#101] One year after his discovery, logarithms were discovered. Kepler immediately threw himself on them and wrota a book about them {broad interest? Kept learning?} [EW: 'heavenly bodies move in circles/energy is continuous – it can be hard to see that they may be debatable] Also did work on optics, first to suggest that vision in eye is upside down.

Kessels, Erik: [#Int28022013] Did not consider himself talented, just drew all the time. First went to 'etaleer'-education, but decided to start illustrating, only blossomed when he entered advertising agency. Thinks that young people should focus/choose in life, not try to do too many things. Everybody can use software to make nice-looking things, but good ideas are as rare as ever. Dislikes 'personal branding': people putting on a nice front yard while their back yard is a mess. First make back yard in order, then work on front yard. Finds intuition very important. Thinks that fear limits creativity, but doubt is good, an eternal battle to make things better. Not afraid of making mistakes; mistakes are good. Imposes a certain uncertainty on himself for every assignment: is this good enough?

Ketamine: [NS2015'A pill to protect against stress?'] Administering ketamine to  stressed mice prevents the depressive effects of stress (mice don't give up swimming), even though it does not suppress the anxiety effect. Note that chronic use can damage the brain and bladder.

King, Larry: [DePers,010507] Never prepares questions, usually asks the 5Ws and the how, eye contact, not saying that much, and never trapping/'te grazen nemen' his guests. Likes people. Even when talking with Nixon – reference mutual friends and shared moments. Treats everyone with respects, even 'platte'/plebeian guests. Never critical questions, but fills happy vacuum between journalism and entertainment.

King, Stephen: [#King3] One parent household, mother moved around a lot. Father piled up bills and ran when Stephen was 2 (brother was 4). Does not believe (anymore) that writers are made, either by circumstances or self-will.Earliest memory was imagining himself to be someone else (Ringling brother) and toes being mashed by evil cinderblock. Perhaps highly sensitive + high imagination given his vivid impressions and humorous descriptions of Eulah-Beulah etc. As a youngster, had appetite for hearing about death? 9 months in bed in first grade due to disease. Intense pain (and doctor lied – did King have strong feelings about justice also). Disease – spent lots of time of first grade reading comic books as he could not go to school yet. Copied stories word for word, adding descriptions occasionally. Mother was extremely charmed with his story. But was disappointed for it to be a copy – write one of your own. Gave quarter apiece for Stephen's stories. Mother also used figurative language (hand under eyes teacher to prevent them falling out). Was somewhere glad that they only got TV when he was 11. Sent first story to science fiction magazine by Ackerman. First real publication in horror fanzine. Mother was funny and slightly nutty (high O?). Think's writer's job is not to find great ideas, but recognize them when they show up. 'Happy stamps' born when mother complained about having too little stamps for lamp + green tongue. (exaggerating both distress and rewards). Submitted, was rejected again and agin, but never gave up. Took about 4 years to get rejection slips with more encouraging notices. Brother had high amounts of energy and creativity – therefore made 'Dave's Rag'. But was not interested in technical stuff – loved movies, however. Didn't like wholesomeness and predictability of Disney movies and musicals. Went to horror movies with a friend. Had the idea of novelizing the movie of 'The Pit and the Pendulum' and sell copies at school.

Kinship: [#Paul/EW] Feelings of kindhip are often due to shared thoughts and experiences, also movement (singing/dancing/marching). [EW: would it help to do those things in advance to create a mind melt?]

KIPP: [#Coyle] KIPP-schools are very disciplinary schools that raise children to go to top universities. But are they just teaching for the exam or teaching true genius? Or would the stability and perhaps stimulation work well? {EW it seems as if students are broken into new habits to perhaps destabilize their own habits and make them amenable to a new identity as KIPP students, the uniforms undoubtedly help too. Perhaps emphasizing the unsafety? Attention to detail? (angle of binders)} [#Robi231] A school for poor children put the kids clean clothes on in the morning, and made them change to their regular clothes in the evening, lest the clean clothes get dirty or disappear miraculously. Also an example of reframing, giving the children a different mindset in school than in the home?

Kirkpatrick's four level training evaluation model: [#http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/isd/kirkpatrick.html] First level: did trainees like the training? Second level: what did they learn? Third level: did the training impact how people approached work? Fourth level: did the training impact the desired goal (productivity, accuracy, etc.)

KITA: [#Pers136] The “kick in the ass”-approach – usually a 'motivational' strategy of executives. Main effect is not that people try do the work, but try to appear doing the work.

Klingberg: [#NRC051105] Swedish researcher who found good influence on ADHD by training working memory.

Knaves: [#Schmid51] Knaves, who are jealous and want success at the cost of others, the team or the company, should be getten rid of; close collaboration can help them being detected and flushed out. Divas, which are ‘merely’ unusual and difficult to work with, should be tolerated as long as their contributions match their egos.

Knewton: investigate!

Knight, Darius: [#Syed134] Young table tennis player, who progressed incredibly well in a shed, failed at first when he got into a 'professional training centre' where he was considered talented; getting the fixed mindset, diminishing practice, and avoiding matches. Was only turned around when a new head of training made the other trainers preach the gospel of effort.

Know+journalist questions: [#Susski194] Know-who, know-when (to act or not to), know-why, know-what, know-where (where to go for help, guidance or expertise), know-how (procedural knowledge).

Knowledge: [#Asimov] Obtained by books, observing, thinking? {EW +experimenting?} [#Colv96] The knowledge of top performers is integrated and connected and less superficial than that of novices. {more abstracting, connecting, salient points?}[#EricB525] Knowledge can be a tradeoff with search, at least in chess. But in chess, knowledge can also lead one to neglect shorter but unusual possibilities. [#EW] Knowledge may not hamper creativity by excess, experience may mainly hinder creativity by making a person accept the status quo, and not be interested in improving it. That the relation between education and creativity is curvilinear may just mean that the 'easiest/most conforming' people are happiest and most adaptable. Howeverm [#Ster229] makes it clear that indeed experts can find it harder to change and get out of habitual patterns. So there is a mental 'rut' or attractor. [#Interm250311] Children can know the tricks that commercials use, but fall for them nonetheless; parents asking questions and encouraging the children to reason/talk about the commercial can help. [#HeaB23] Knowledge is not enough to change {you apparently need emotions as well to give the action sufficient priority} [#Schafer9] The true use of knowledge {EW: like my 8 laws} are not whether you know them, but if you apply them and they have become a habit. [#EW] Knowledge may be a shortcut to intellect, see how Pizarro outsmarted the Inca. [#RoadExcel] Experts not only have more knowledge than novices, their knowledge is also better-organized. [#NS11022012] It may be more useful to have a lot of (vaguely) unreliable knowledge than only have a hand-picked selection. It's also useful to have knowledge 'hyperlinks', a barnacle can be like a mollusc in one context, and like rust in another context like ship hull dangers. [#Hargit86] The discovery of the polio vaccine was based on a very careful review of the literature on viruses and tissue cultures. Or skills: the discoverer of cubane spent just two weeks on it, and considered it almost a sidenote to his decades of organic synthesis. [#Hargit181] A physicist switched to molecular biology after an enthusiastic conversation – others, like Edison, praised the benefit of a broad education, of knowing enough little facts about the world. Gilbert said that a PhD taufght him how to decide whether something is right or wrong, and that that was transferable. You can learn the particular knowledge of any field in a short time. [EW: at least for scientific fields, perhaps] [#Strien109] Experts may need about 50000 experience units. [#138] Jenner based his vaccination on farmer's wisdom that getting cowpocks immunized you for normal pocks. [#Seth74] Even Fritz Haber was told by the government that it would not need his skills or expertise. Government trusted in the briefness of the war, and in the might of the military machine. [#EWL260614] In any job, there is a 'rope-pulling' between broad and deep knowledge, generalists and specialists. A generalist is flexible in seeing different possible classes of solutions and classes of problems, but an expert is better at devising complicated solutions to very difficult problems and seeing the exact cause of the problem in a specific category (of course, some people are neither generalists or experts) [#NS170617ASeriesOfFortunateEvents/EW] Knowledge has some discovery rate, an extinction rate (which depends on direct feedback and such). People are very good imitators, and teaching also helped.

Knowledge acceptance: [#EW] Mathematicians wanted to construct their own things; neurologists rather built from models. The kind of science you'll do may therefore also be influenced by the level of understanding you strive for – full understanding which requires relatively few separate facts (maths) but doesn't allow you/need a great deal of knowledge, or decent understanding of a lot of things which requires acceptance of a great amount of unproven/halfproven material (biology, and psychological sciences in particular)

Knowledge access: [#EricB54] A problem with novices is that they have trouble accessing relevant knowledge in a situation, even though they do possess the knowledge (since they respond appropriately to the experimenter's cue) {EW: could be too weak activation/link of the new knowledge?}

Knowledge network: [#EW] A knowledge network could be considered as a network of nouns with both properties (for example: “Eric Marcel Wubbo Lameijer” property: length – value = 1m87) as relationship with other objects “Eric Marcel Wubbo Lameijer” <connected to/connecting line> “Nanette Helene Marguerita Lameijer” with relationship brother of/sister of (opposite side of lines). A relation can also have a date range and strength (so – properties of relation) You have closer and farther friends. Note that nouns are unique (so objects), relationships are not (there instances of a class 'friendship', for example), and each particular instance of a relationship a separate object with separate properties (strength, affect, duration)

Knowledge publishing: [#EricB95] Expert systems that gather information relevant to a user's problem (similar to smarter web search engines).

Knowledge spillover: [#Interm20042012-Zubanov] The achievement of a company increase for four years when they hire someone from a more productive company, the effect getting stronger the higher the function is; external hires may be more disappointing than internal promotions, but they can help that way.

Knowledge vault: Google project to index all knowledge.

Kornberg, Arthur: [#Hargit139] Found work at NIH increasingly uninspiring, was however jumpstarted by a seminar about genes by Edward Tatum. Formed an informal group with three other young scientists, meeting every noon for lunch and reviewed the current literature very seriously, read Journal of Biological Chemistry from cover to cover. [#148] Wife, Sylvy, was closest collaborator, robbed of Nobel prize.

Kornberg, Roger: [#C2W21012012] Studied with Laurens van Deenen (first wrote him a letter, then Van Deenen invited him over). Initial major was English literature. Chose chemistry inspired by brilliant friends, William Lipskomb and Elias Corey. Wanted to learn everything that a chemical professional needs, not in a superficial way, but as deep (diepgaand) as possible, from the best possible mentors. Thinks that sharing ideas is important, teaches you to look critically at your own ideas, and learn from criticism and remarks of other scientists.

Krebs: [#Erard152] Unpleasant person who did not like to be told what to do, but extremely fanatic (and good) at learning languages. So disagreeable that nobody wanted to work with him.

Kroto, Harold: [#C2W, 200913] Thinks it is much better if young scientists do research they excel in (?that interests them?) instead of 'strategic research'. Kroto seems to enjoy attention (though trying to hide it). Advises students to care mainly about good research, not about publication statistics. It's the 'dagelijkse praktijk' (daily practice?) of science, learning technologies, the 'nitty gritty' of science that is most important. [EW: so do the best you can, every day]. Has Bertrand Russell as one of his examples, who protested against atomic tests, and persevered.

Kwast, Ernest van der: [#INT030812] Mom pressured him to work hard, accidentally went into writing plays in highschool, only dared disobey his mother and jump into literature when he had his bachelor. [born in Bombay?] Perfectionist, can work for hours to get a talkshow just right. Never misses a deadline (C?), though that does may give lack of sleep and lots of stress (has osteopath at age 31)

L2Tor: robot language tutor, uses a NAO robot by Aldenaran Robotics. Can also be used by letting the robot write a word wrongly, and letting a child step in and correct it.

Labeling: [#Greene191] Inventions can be made since most people jump to categorizing and labeling things, never trying alternative views. [#Nass137] Labeling happy people as happy is wise (liking+, competence+). Labeling sad people as happy may be bad for competence, but good for liking. So never tell people they seem sad.

Labelling technique: [#Gold59] Assigning a desired trait to someone influences that person to behave that way (“There is still good in you, darth vader”). Can also be used implicitly (“Thank you for choosing this airline”). [#Hatt123] Destructively, labeling students as 'having learning difficulties' does negatively affect performance. [#Redirect99] If you encourage children to label an emotion as 'guilt', they're less likely to repeat the behaviour than if you encourage them to label it as 'disappointment about being caught”. Can also be used “this is a non-litter-class” to build identity as non-litterers. [#SellHuman138] Labeling a game either as the 'Wall Street game' or as the 'Community Game' can drastically impact cooperation

Labour market: [#EW] If supply for something exceeds demand, this can be because of the 'drug baron effect' (small chance of large rewards). In any case, high supply reduces wages for the majority. If there are no 'drug barons' (like at schools), the highly competent people will seek other careers. Another way to fight this effect is to artificially restrict supply, like with numerus fixus. Supply itself can be influenced by other opportunities for competent people (very smart people becoming teachers during the Depression)

Lack: [#Franzen91] Adler: we all see a 'lack' in ourselves, that we try to compensate.

Lameijer, Eric-Wubbo: Lessen (van IntelliMagic). Lage E, hoge N: moeilijk gelukkig te maken. Hoge O: goed voor het vinden van nieuwe kennis/krijgen van nieuwe ideeën. Relatief hoge A -klantcontact belangrijk, slechte GUI akelig, gevoelig voor hoger doel, publieke goed. Geen fantastische specialist – kennis waarmee technische of specialistische kennis wordt opgedaan laag. Hekel aan hierarchie/senioriteits-gebaseerd beslissen. Zwakte: wil dingen begrijpen, kan te zeurderig/grondig zijn bij reviews. Zwakte: vind slechte architectuur akelig. Hoog zelfvertrouwen. Zwakte: niet altijd goed inschatten van karakter bazen, is zelf relatief laag in defensiteit, niet automatisch gevoelig voor discretie. Kracht: bereidheid met anderen te praten. Kracht: ingewikkelde problemen kunnen oplossen. Labour market: dangerous combination of a) low social skills, b) high N (doesn't easily feel at home), c) high O (does not easily fit into one box for the coming 30 years), d) high self-efficacy/confidence (yes I can) so not easily cowed. Also typical long-term perspective (5-10 years), does not like kamikaze careers – need to be balance between what employer wants and what I want. Also some ambition (I want X), more than fear (what if people disapprove of me?). Dislikes doing evil (or may have rigid ideas about good and evil). Core talents [giving energy]: constructive creativity, information transfer, strategy, broad knowledge acquisition, showmanship. Possibly other values / hofstede dimensions than IM?

Lang, Lang: [#http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/12/lang-lang-piano] I sometimes find classical music difficult to access. You just have to take your time and listen carefully. If you get frustrated, do something different - find a new piece of music or change activities, then come back to the piano. At this year's BBC Proms I performed Chopin, so Chopin has recently become a big part of my life. Last year, it was Beethoven. Each year I have a different focus - it's like finding a new favourite dish every year.

Langmuir: [#Jaffe239] Very curious child, parents trying to answer questions as well as possible. Older brother studied chemistry, together created a laboratory in the basement when Irving was nine. Disliked school, just loved to tinker and experiment in his lab. Family went to Paris when Irving was 11, since his brother wanted to study in Heidelberg. Also went mountain climbing with his brother [?adored elder brother?] Father forced him to carefully draw plans for his mountain treks. Witnessed the funeral of Pasteur. After college, did PhD research under Nernst. First became chemistry teacher, but wanted to do labwork for fun in his summer holiday, went to General Electric, where he was free to wander around and choose his subject. Read a lot in his area, remembered JJ Thomson's writings on gases absorbed by metals. Was hired there, and used 'trick' to increase the concentration of 'noxious' gases, to learn to know them better. [#wiki] During his childhood, Langmuir's parents encouraged him to carefully observe nature and to keep a detailed record of his various observations.

Language development: [#NRC200811] The language development of children is stimulated a lot when teachers use beautiful words, correct sentences and tell exciting stories {EW: perhaps this explains why talking in a broken foreign tongue to your child is a bad idea, and why teachers with low intelligence/vocabulary harm education}

Language learning: [#NRC231112] Children learn a language well if they can hear and use it often, and see it as important (motivation very important). For that it is important how much status a language has in the child's environment. Children learning two languages may learn things a bit more slowly, and gives rise to confusion in the beginning, but that passes. But don't stop – keep educating children bilingually else the second language is forgotten again. From 7 years old, learning a language without accent is almost impossible; and 17-year olds are adults. [#NS250513] Adults learn right accents much faster when listening to the exaggerated baby talk of cooing mothers. [#NS230711] Adults and 12-year-olds generally can work out grammatical rules, which makes their scores soar. Even the pronounciation of children is inferior to those of older subjects. So implicit learning was not intense enough, I guess, explicit learning can take part of the burden and help memory. But will it also give fluency? [#Wyner] Wyner says: start with pronounciation. Do NOT translate. A word has structure, sound, meaning and personal connection, the latter 3 work 2x, 4x and 6x as good for memory as merely the structure. Note that the brain, by default, is set to the lowest possible processing level [EW: like when listening to talks?] [EW: and your emotional impression of the pronounciation?] And could an abstract word (like birthday) be anchored to concrete words? [#47] Minimal pairs can work for hearing difference between phonemes, but training only works when (immediate?) feedback is given [EW: and blocked?] [#89] Backchaining: remembering/pronouncing a long word: start with the last part (because that becomes easier?) forvo.com, rhino-spike, FSI-language-courses.org. Remembering gender of word: male explodes, female burns, neuter splinters. [EW] Note that it takes time to make a grammatical sentence, possibly writing is easier; as otherwise you will start with the simple forms that are best remembered “I Tarzan”[#140] You learn a language faster by learning its grammar rules [EW really? No reference…] Grammatical sentences to SRS: Do I see new words here? Word shapes? Does the order surprise me? [#146] Abstract words can be learned by fill-in exercises, “- is your address?” [#154] For remembering classes of nouns/verbs [like typical conjugations] etc. For verbs: person or object. For nouns: persons or actions. For adjectives: objects. Adverbs: actions. [#156] You can practice writing on Lang-8. [#181] Reading with an audiobook next to it may work. TV-series also, as long as they are not comedies, and not subtitled. But you may want to use Wikipedia for summaries of the show so you are lost less. Select carefully! Verbling.com en Livemocha.com. A language holiday may also help.

Languages: [#Ungex/EW] Language is often a way to communicate the state of the world, often on the states/properties/(semantic) features of objects/persons, which often implies/limits actions. However, objects do not only have features, but also associations with feelings and events 'comfortable' 'my first love affair' and so on...('reality is illusion'). [#SciAmMindND09] Jennie Pyers discovered that deaf people with a primitive version of sign language performed worse at a theory-of-mind task. [Still, chimps can do better? Or is language, once acquired, the preferred route for thinking?] [#NRCWilliamCroft] Languages don't have 'nouns' or 'verbs', but words to refer to things (reference), to say things about them (predication) and to add information to those elements (modification) [#NS05052012] Which language you use (as a bilingual) influences thought patterns: real friends (Japanese) … should help each other out (English) be very frank. Bilingualism seems to improve the executive system, the system able to block irrelevant stimuli. Bilinguals also better able to put themselves in other people's shoes, better able to block out what they already know. Bilingual children also show increased activity in response to unfamiliar languages at the end of the first year. [#Erard49] The language you dream in is usually the language you used just before sleeping {EW: like idea loading?} => try speak/do in a language like Chinese or japanese? Students reporting speaking French in their dreams relatively soon reported faster progress that those who didn't. [50] People can me mad in one language and sane in another. [54] Game with hosts to quote obscure proverbs to one another. For conversation, no perfect vocabulary is needed, mainly ability to ask for clarification, communicate understanding, and rephrasing one's request or description, amongst other things. [#Erard81] Some people, like Ken Hale, used languages to get in contact with people (which they felt afraid of usually) Tip: start asking a native speaker for words for body parts, animals, things in the environment. Then ask for nouns and verbs and start building sentences. Lomb Kato: worked hard, was not afraid of failure, read prolifically. Wrote book “How I learn languages”. Would speaking help? [#Erard136] Digital language repeater. [#Erard182] What predicts good English is using lots of English. [#Erard215] Best language learners are meaning-oriented and pattern-seeking. Also sharpeners: distinguish minute differences between sounds and meanings. Is shadowing effective? [238] People with higher Openness may be more willing to sound not like themselves. Mimic the way others talk (accent and body language and intonation and pitch). Introverts seem motr succesful than extraverts. [251] Even the 'polyglot of flanders' needed reactivation time for most of his languages. Quite some contestants to the contest were left-handed or were born in the middle of the summer. [259] Be willing to be laughed at. Arm movements and spoken language are controlled in the same part of the brain. Mezzofanti talked to himself in his languages when he was alone. Also invented games {EW: to keep himself concentrated?} [#NS101211] Complex grammars are more common in small languages with little contact with the outside world – children tend to make grammar complex to help remember meaning, adults find it hard to learn complex grammar. So the more people learn the language as an adult, the simpler the grammar tends to be. Can diverge in 500 years, often because groups feel need to affirm their new identity. Climate that favours biodiversity makes it also easier for small splinter groups to survive on their own. Rate of infectious disease in tropical regions may also make groups avoid one another. Serial founder effect of phonemes (less in every newer language). Warmer climates: more vowels, easier to communicate outdoors. N and m more for warmer regions, obstruents like t and g for colder regions. Dense vegetation reduces need for vowels. Two genes in brain development are more common in places where people speak tonal languages. [#NS260610] Deaf people who have learned advanced versus simple sign language are better at spatial tasks [EW: language helps memory?] [#NRC_thesJantienSmit] Maths teachers should pay more attention the the language that kids use, and ask kids to be more precise; especially non-native speakers profit from that, because in regular 'extra language' lessons, they lack the specific vocabulary of maths. [#https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141125145029-156042194-why-i-speak-dutch-but-i-don-t-speak-dutch?midToken=AQETzM5pyesy4g&trk=eml-b2_content_ecosystem_digest-recommended_articles-165-null&fromEmail=fromEmail&ut=2INGSs9bbqJmw1] Networking: calling a Dutch person in English may work better than calling them in Dutch. [#NS261215...KeithChen] Speakers of languages that don’t make a distinction between present tense and past tense with special markers (say English: “it will rain tomorrow” vs Chinese “it rain tomorrow” are more likely to act in ways that would improve their future well-being, such as financial saving and not smoking. {other researcher} When a language gets a word for something, like ‘amae’ people feel/observe it more. [#Evans84] Language changes because we want to distinguish ourselves, or identify ourselves with a certain group, or because we are lazy. [#Hofste327] Having worse (English) language skills makes people underestimate the career potential. [#HayesS11] Since language works in two directions, even a word or paper can bring (back) emotional pain, even if the original cause is not present.

Lapidaire paradox: [#CAMGroot] “Met ons gaat het slecht (verindividualiserender samenleving) maar met mij gaat het goed”

LAPP-Top (and pre-university college): Check!

Latent inhibition: [#Eyse151] Something is learned with more difficulty if the stimulus which has been familiar before suddenly acquires meaning. [#http://www.wisconsinacappella.com/what-can-make-a-genius-bbc-horizon/] Some people have less latent inhibition – can't concentrate as easily, but can have creative ideas pouring in. [#Feist50] intelligent and highly creative students have less latent inhibition that noncreative controls.

Latent learning: [#Grin114] Exploration, play, imitation. Is probably rewarded internally, differences in sensitivity for reward may explain difference in curiosity between people (and school achievements? And IQ?). [#Wiki] No reward or overt response given, but rats meandering through a maze also learn it, though without reward they just seem to meander.

Laterborn effect: [#EW] Many sporters and singers seem to be later-born (runners, Agassi, and at least Michael and Janet Jackson). This in contrast to scientists, who are often first-born (son) or only child. The most probabl explanation is that in 'competitive' fields later-born tend to start at a younger age, and have parents with more experience in educating in the field. {EW: check with Bloom's tennis players?}

Latin: [#http://www.ifvll.ethz.ch/people/sterne/haag_stern_2003.pdf] Not useful for other subjects (at least not more useful than English)

Laurance, Ewa: [#Robi89] Pool player, was enchanted by pool at age 14. Fell in love with the atmosphere there, and seems to have flow when playing billiards. Did get support from parents, allowed to play 6-10 hours a day in the local poolroom. Moved to VS to play against the world's top.

Lavoisier: [#Jaffe75] Wealthy parents (merchants). Studied both maths and physics, mentor/role model Guillaume Rouelle, who was extremely enthusiastic and dared disprove the professor's theories with experiments. Also met Lineaus, who also inspired Lavoisier to become a scientist. Also started writing a tragedy (never completed), ate just bread and milk to save time. Worked 13-hour days. Had many interests, including hypnosis and civic safety. Became guest of Jaques de Hastenholles, who organized meetings where preeminent mathematicians and even Benjamin Franklin came. Used a 'pelican' (so knew the diverse instruments). Was a very accurate worker, and his thoughts became clearer as he read about the works of his predecessors or reproduced it. When he thought he had found the secret of oxidation, sent it to the academy in a sealed envelope to ensure priority without publishing. After visiting Priestley started his famous 12-day experiment {so definitely learned from others}. Did not credit Priestley, however. Together with friends (one a playwright) developed a new chemical nomenclature [collaboration – or perhaps also a method to become more famous?] Could be generous though and tried to help the poor with science, political influence and his own wealtth. [#Jeffe250] Had the principle not to try an area of science where the most important principles were still missing.

Law: [#EricD440] Sometimes law can demand bad textbooks in schools – teachers must be innovative to deal with an imperfect world.

Law of financial viability: [#Newport137] Do what people are willing to pay for – by aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable.

Law of near enough: [#NS150314] “The Improbability Principle” (book review): something improbable happens (or seems to happen) since things that are sufficiently similar are regarded as identical.

Lazy: [#Root] The most successful scientists claimed to be 'lazy' even though they worked very long hours, because they valued relaxation as a way to refresh their minds. [#Burn393] Laziness and apathy can be the symptoms of depression, and then certainly do not correspond to ones “true self” anymore than a cough does. [#Scho70] Laziness can be necessary from time to time, have a special spot for laziness (different from sleeping spot!) [#HeaB12] What looks like laziness counteracting a change, is often exhaustion of willpower! [#http://www.intermediair.nl/magazine/20150212/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2015wk07&utm_campaign=iw&e=1&m_i=eSNeHqZ0PtTililsaYZu9iCcKBPBDvupdOTElMnjIO5GELn0m9ApXAsLRfeMU3r2TFYyXt%2B_9enkwmJq4Zob9PU1xXnSA#5] Lazy employees are generally those employees that don't get enough positive feelings about their work (so energy through learning new stuff, having great colleagues, and so on)

Leaders: [#EWL/Sidis] Having a leader abdicates a person from responsibility for his actions and therefore blame; he or she can continue to be a good, respectable person, because he/she was 'just following orders.' Of course, in reality one has a choice which leader to follow, and which commands to obey, which is conveniently forgotten by such people. While leaders can actually benefit society and make it more likely to succeed in certain endeavours, blind obedience to them can be counterproductive and even dangerous. [#Flourish149] The optimism or pessimism of the leader is representative of (or infects?) the whole team. [#Loehrs161] Leaders who built most successful companies had mixture of fierce resolve and humility.[#EW] Interessant is dat het grootste deel van de lustrumalmanak gevuld is met de vorige besturen, de beschrijving van het huidige bestuur, en de lofprijzingen van zusterbesturen- narcissime? [#Schmid193] “Noses in, fingers out” may be best for board meetings. You want feedback, but not that they decide.

Leadership: [#EricB444] Can be more effective when shared. Also people must believe that the leader cares about them. Leaders should provide situation updates, and self-correct first. [#EWL/Zimb] Laissez-fair leaders generally have the worst results, autocratic leaders only work when present, democratic leadership works best. [#Loeh161] The best leaders are those who combine fierce resolve with humility.[#Tigg55] Leadership often involves changing people's behaviour. Either work via intentions (by telling, setting an example, or letting the other think), or via situations, preferably both! But always start with establishing that both parties see the necessity of change. [#Hatt83] Instructional leadership (learning climate free of disruptions, system of clear teaching objectives, high teacher expectations for teachers and students) more effective than tranformational leadership (inspire staff to new levels of energy, commitment, and moral purpose so they work together to overcome challenges and reach ambitious goals). Promoting and participating teacher learning and development is very important, but also participating in teacher evaluations by classroom visits, good allocation of resources, and establishing goals and expectations. Instructional leaders focus on achievement, so they achieve achievement, while transformational leaders focus too much on leader-follower relationships. [#Granovetter] Whether a person trusts a leader depends heavily on whether there exist intermediary personal contacts who can, from their own knowledge, assure him that the leader is trustworthy and who can, if necessary, intercede with the leader or his lieutenants on his behalf. [#http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1] For leaders, it's most important that you are consistent, fair, and somewhat predictable in your decisions; if you're all over the place people don't dare to do anything. [#NS040513] Taller people (>10 cm taller than average for your sex) are perceived as more intelligent, tall males are addictionally perceived as more dominant, more healthy and more vigorous. Youthful looks are preferred in times of change, mature faces in times of stability. Males during conflicts, feminine faces if cooperation is needed. [#Catmull] Ask people what is and what isn’t working. ][#EWL] Depensds on ambition, fear, kindness, emotional and intellectual expertise. [#Catmul228] Include people in your problem, not just in your solutions. [#Stalla67] Don’t have excessive rules and controls, do not micromanage. And eliminate excessive signs of hierarchy. Get rid of devaluing leaders, and don’t have devaluing severance procedures. Make a human connection to as many people as possible. Learn names and personal stories, acknowledge what they say to you. Also help employees know each other’s stories. Intranet -hobbies, favorite books and such that they like to share. Treat employees like partners. Help employees find the right role, given personality, abilities, right degree of challenge, and consistent with values and identity. Educate, inform and listen to employees. Let employees know what is happening. Delegate decision making (letting people closest to the relevant information make the decision). Realize human need for work/life balance. Listen to people, knowledge flows increases connection and fires up people. MacArthur wouldn’t listen to the British, Montgomery wouldn’t listen to the Americans, but Eisenhower listened, was open-minded and confident without being arrogant or condescending. Value constructive confrontation and helpful Cassandras. Make knowledge flow horizontally and bidirectionally vertically. Organize knowledge flow sessions. Use intranet. Promote culture of responsiveness (return phone call within 24 hours). Ask other people’s views; what is right, what is wrong, what is missing? [#119] Universal values (Seligman’s ones) can be linked to VVV, to universal human needs (meaning, respect, recognition, belonging, autonomy, personal growth), and to good things for employees (trust, cooperation, empathy, enthusiasm, optimism, energy, creativity, superior problem solving) and companies (employee engagement, better decisions, innovation, productivity, profitability, customer satisfaction, employee retention, safety). Don’t develop a self-righteous culture, “good in the worst sense of the word.” [#199] More than 70% of leaders do not finish well. [#Schmid180] It is exactly the bad news that leaders most need to hear. Good news will be just as good tomorrow, but bad news will be worse. Also conduct postmortems, and post the findings for everyone to see. Also have TGIFs (sessions where Larry answers questions), where people can submit a question to the Dory system, where the best questions get upvoted. Lame answers get a red paddle from the audience (instead of a green). Climb, confess and comply (like pilots): first get yourself out of danger, then explain what went wrong, and then listen to suggestions. Make your own user manual for your subordinates, + ‘how to fix you if you break’. [#Schmid153] Data is usually best understood by those closest to the issue, which is often not management. Beware of ‘bobble-head yessers’ who say ‘yes’, but outside the meetings complain and whine and do not support or do the thing they have agreed to. To get consensus, you need dissent, because you won’t get buying unless all choices are discussed openly. People who are quiet need to be drawn out. People who don’t have anything to say should not be in the meeting. You need inclusion (everyone needs to be heard), cooperation (doing what is best for the group) and equality (everyone in the team can at least for some time engage in blocking behaviour). Choose the best decision, not the ‘lowest common denominator’ on which everyone agrees. If there are more facts, there is less interpersonal conflict. And set a deadline for decisions. “Do something, even if it is wrong” - bias for action. Though of course, in some cases, like negotiation, you need to be patient. For tough decisions, meet daily. People need to feel something before they change their minds. “You’re both right” to make even losing parties feel heard. Disagree but commit, or escalate publicly (give people choice). Meetings should have a single decision maker/owner (usually a more senior person). That decision maker should be hands-on (invite people, make notes). No more than 8 people, 10 at a stretch. Otherwise can’t hear everyone’s input, and observers make people more reluctant to speak out. Meetings should be easy to kill (should have a clear purpose. If not, or purpose not reached: why have the meeting?) [#https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292797?utm_source=sendgrid&utm_medium=email&utm_content=jeff_bezos&utm_campaign=allnewsjunev1 JeffBezos] Avoid “day 2” by obsessive customer focus, avoiding proxies (making process holy), embrace external trends, high-velocity decision making (70% of wanted info is good, disagree but commit, be willing to stop when you turned out to be wrong, and escalate immediately when you notice misalignment between parties.

Learned helplessness: [#Flourish189] About one third of people (and dogs, and rats) never became helpless; about 1/10th were helpless to begin with and did not need to be taught passivity. The 1/3rd believed that the causes of setbacks were temporary, changeable and local. [#Tigg192] If people set (or are set) a goal, which is unachievable due to circumstances without their control, people get 'acquired helplessness' and don't perform actions anymore and feel less committed to the goal. [#Seligm185] There is nothing you can do about the event => Learn that any effort to escape is usless, so even do not try in different circumstances.

Learned industriousness: [#HoweX413] The phenomenon that if high mental or physical effort is rewarded, the sensation of high effort becomes less aversive, and subjects are more likely to display great(er) efforts on subsequent tasks.

Learner: [#Colv200] Being regarded as a fast learner by one's teacher was very motivating (disregarding whether it's true). {EW: child sees opportunity to shine. May create a somewhat fixed mindset though, though probably not so bad as 'talented'} [#Nels97] When learning an object-oriented programming language, five groups of learners can be distinguished: slow and steady, least experienced in programming, who easily grasp the basic concepts but are flummoxed by the complexity of the programming environment, they study examples and slowly accumulate insight. Hardest worker gets very good grade. (so no “Aha!”) The zealots had high-school programming experience and were more enthousiastic. It clicked when they threw away the manual and tried to design things themselves. Well-rounded programmers with broad experience had not much trouble, though their confidence made some of them start rather late. Single paradigm programmers had much more trouble learning it. Minimalists didn't like the work, liked class more as resume-enhancer, or simply didn't have the time. [#Hatt22] Learners learn best when they become their own teachers (with self-monitoring, self-evaluation etc.)

Learner control: [#Clar324] Learners only benefit from higher learner control if they have high metacognitive skills; however, all learners prefer higher learner control. Best you can do in such cases is to allow moderate learner control but give suggestions on lesson sequences, or make the best sequence the default route.

Learner-centered: Learning-centered trainers focus on the needs of the learners and their jobs, NOT on the subject matter. (it should be remarked that most schools do the opposite). There should be an inventory of the learner's needs, desires, fears, characteristics, problems and current knowledge.

Learning burden: [#Nati23] The amount of effort required to learn something (like a word). Does not only depend on the item, but also on the knowledge already present in the individual. Can be reduced by teachers pointing out patterns and connections. Learning burden also depends on whether there are already similar sounds/words in L1. Decreases also if the word contains already known word-parts.

Learning environment: [#EW/Boekaerts4] Ideally you want a good learning environment, with a minimum of distractions.

Learning goals: [#HowX427] Subjects who were asked to get a computer program to the 'very friendly' state implicitly, but not explicitly learned the rules. Subjects asked for patterns more often gave the rule, though often incorrect since they did not correct original hypotheses. The most correct answers came from learners who has been asked to explain their reasoning.

Learning hierarchy: [#EricB80] Needing to know one thing before another thing can be learned/understood. See also Gagné. [#Hatt169] The effect of learning hierarchies is however quite low, though not too bad at the elementary level. For high schools they're about worthless (d=0.07).

Learning investment: [#Switch171] Most new technologies require a learning period of decreased productivity, leading to better performance later.

Learning methods: [#Schm209] The learning method that is preferred by the learner may not be the one that yields the most learning.

Learning objectives: [#EricB72] Already used by the sophists, learning objectives helped education (the student knew what to learn/pay attention to!). [#Clar128] Learning objectives (like questions) can be efficient methods to focus attention.

Learning prestations: [#NRC020607] Learning prestations are mainly determined by self-study, NOT by the amount of contact hours. [#EW: though I believe that there was generally more self-study if there were more contact hours]

Learning speed: [#Howe4] There were no appreciable differences between music students in the number of hours they needed to improve by a particular amount or grade; musical talent was not visible in learning speed. [#Bloo4] 95% of children are very similar in learning speed, it is possible that 1-2% are exceptionally gifted, but there is little evidence for that. [#EduNRC] Many teachers go WAY too fast in covering the material, as an unfortunate group of Tilburg teachers discovered in Marocco ('Ana ismi ina – newcomers in Morocco), they just block after a while and do not take up information anymore. /Students also had the idea that they never knew what was expected of them, and whether they were learning anything useful) [#NS04022012] Focusing your attention on a point away from your body increases learning speed, as does transcranial magnetic stimulation of the right region. [International journal of sport science & coaching, vol 6, p 99]. Producing alpha waves characteristic of the flow state (neurofeedback + deliberately controlling one's breathing) also greatly reduces time needed to learn to shoot like a pro.

Learning zone: [#EW] Between comfort zone and panic zone, the learning zone is the zone in which one learns anything. The zones are however not discrete. Whereas the middle or end of the learning zone may provide much learning yet little pleasure, the beginning of the learning zone may not teach us so much, but in a much more pleasurable way. The Brontë children were probably in the beginning of the learning zone, the practicing musicians nearer the end. Also ones achievements depend on where in his or her learning/comfort zone he or she is. Finally confidence may influence how 'happy' someone is with a problem.

Lectures: [#Watt41] Next to reading and observing and experimenting, a method of learning. Can be more lively and inspiring than mere reading. [#Medsker211] Suffered from focus on general behaviour in general situations. Part was because didn't remember or didn't know in practice, and of little feedback  and no reinforcement for using appropriate behaviours.

Left-handedness: [#Ster330] Left-handedness occurs relatively much in geniuses – but perhaps because it reflects underlying brain pathology/defiance from the norm? [#Feist51] It in any case occurs in mathematically precocious children, could be increased bilateral thinking? [#Int030812] Very prevalent in competitive sports, especially with direct competition (left-handers have had more practice dealing with right-handers than right-handers have in dealing with lefthanders), but not in golf (but perhaps also because there is little good left-handed golf material)! Have slightly higher chance of schizophrenia since they have (I guess a polymorphism) in the gene LRRTM1.

Legacy-exercise: [#Lyubom225] What do I want to leave behind?

Lehn, Jean-Marie: [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368_supp/full/478S8a.html] Nobel-prize winner, next to science is enthusiastic about music. My motivation was simply that I was interested in science and research and in gaining new knowledge. All of the sciences are exciting. The great frustration is that one cannot do everything. You have to be selective to have an impact. Everybody has a given amount of energy, if you apply it on a small area you have a big impact. Too broad and the impact will be weaker.

Leibniz: [#Strien83] Advised people to look at how great predecessors made discoveries (widely ignored) [#Isaac20] Want to make a better calculator, but did not have mechanical aptitude or friends.

Leisure: [#Zill2/EW] Would leisure be the time that is not dedicated to survival and/or reproduction? Perhaps because there are no true opportunities? Social groups often make leisure possible by division of labour (guards), as did food surplus and technological advances. [#EW] Would the high status of leisure discourage rich from working hard? Cicero stressed the preparatory and regenerative functions of leisure.

Lemons: [#SellHuman47] Research by Akerlof: when customer can't judge whether car sold is peach or lemon, prices will drop, making honest deals difficult.”Dishonest dealings tend to drive honest dealings off the market”

Leptin: [#NS211115] Leptin, the hormone indicating satiety, makes dopamine drop. Higher dopamine encourages more action (so mice that run more). Runner's high? People with not so much fat, like marathon runners, or people with anorexia, may be more restless or hyperactive (jolly fat man).

Lesson plan: [#RoadToExcel33] Becoming an expert is a vague process, lessons plans with intermediate goals both increase motivation and opportunities for feedback.

Letter writing: [#Sommers144] Letting students write letters to 'at-risk' middleschoolers, describing that they too had struggled at school sometimes but persevered and eventually found academic success, and emphasize that natural ability is overrated. The writers of the letters scored higher on their exams – and the effect was particularly strong for African-American students.

Level of practice: [#Erics126] Students increase their level of practice before a public performance {EW: consistent with procrastination theory}

Levelers/sharpeners: [#Rost103] A cognitive style (next to field-dependence/field-independence and reflectivity/impulsivity). Levelers use amalgams of many memories to categorize something; they tend to overgeneralize and have blurry memories. Sharpeners often have more distinct memories. {EW: eye for detail? Or levelers not being interested much in details/lower TIE?} {EW: may be tied to spatial ability – though that may be a pre-learning effect!}

Levels-of-processing: [#Wiki] In general, deeper processing (semantic instead of phonlogical/visual) aids memory, though in autistic patients that often seems reversed.

Lewin, Walter: Excellent internet-professor of physics. #NRC120512 Causes: makes a show out of it, lots of preparation [half a year for 35 colleges], many rehearsals. Believes he changes people's view of the world [seems to have extreme ego/mania] strength: keeps people's attention. Questionable: will people study physics because of him? Emotional, easy to get angry, enthousiastic. Says colleagues lack the love for the subject [or are boring]. Keeps adjusting and adapting the lessons endlessly. Needs to feel important (web star). {Of course, this has interview-distortion}

Lewis, Gilbert Newton: [#Jaffe249] Very good scientist and energetic/enthusiastic person.

Lies: [#EW] Since we never know the truth, small lies (“I can do it”) can help us get resilience and creativity. Big lies (“I can make a perpetuum mobile”) harm us. Hard to know when a lie is too big, though...

Lies of success: (A. Robbins). There are seven “lies of success”, called this way because they are only beliefs, and they cannot be objectively proven. I. Everything happens for a reason and a purpose, and it serves us. II. There is no such thing as failure. There are only results. III. Whatever happens, take responsibility. IV. It’s not necessary to be able to understand everything to use everything. V. People are your greatest resource. VI. Work is play. VII. There is no abiding success without commitment.[#EW: seems belief system]

Lieshout, Joep van: [#Busa52] 'I'm an artist, so I make art' – may like to provoke people. Was always inventing things as a child, improving them. Perhaps something from his father, who died young, but who did the same. Used barbecue to melt metals, made a bio-gas installation based on dog droppings. Physics teacher discouraged him to study physics, as you needed to be really good to do creative physics work, else you'd become a teacher. Learned to trust intuition more. My work only 45 hours a week, but does do work that he enjoys and considers important. Fighting against something (people not considering him creative) gave him energy. Thinks that always striving for the best, trying to improve oneself is important. ('de lat hoog legt')

Life history theory: [#NS300416MoralityTale] Life history theory states that if resources are scarce and mortality is high, organisms become more impulsive and aggressive; the rise of Christianty may coincide with the environment becoming more predictable and kind. Note that people fundamentally disapprove of behaviour that threatens their own interests, so the elite may found it wise to condemn impulsive behaviour.

Life laws: [#McGraw33] 1. You either get it or you don't: try to predict/understand other people's behaviour. If you can't, how can you act effectively? Know what the result of actions will be, and what actions will lead to the desired results. Three elements are know rules, have skills, have plan. [and yes, there are times in life when you don't want to miss a good chance to shut up, like with the angry cop. YOU SHOULD ALSO TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN BEHAVIOUR (so you can control it). Problem is that most people rely on role models instead of on formal instruction, and good role models are sparse. Gray dogs: breaking the code through trial-and-error and observation of themselves and others. [add Gray Dog to virtual panel?]. You must overcome other people's resistances and excuses, and get them to adopt your view of the world. What do they value in their lives? [Ethics, money, success?] 2. What are there expectancies and beliefs about how life does and should work? 3. What resistances and predispositions (fears, biases, prejudices) do they have? 4. What positions or approaches or philosophies are they more likely to accept or reject? 5. What do they need to hear from a person to be convinced that that person is basically okay and is to be trusted. 6. What sort of things do they consider relevant? 7. How do they feel about themselves? 8. What do they want most in their lives? [I. Number one fear is rejection II. Number one need is acceptance, III. To manage people effectively, do so in a way that protects or enhances their self-esteem. IV. Everybody approaches a situation with at least some 'what's in it for me? V. Everybody prefers to talk about things that are important to them personally. VI. People hear and incorporate only what they understand. VII. People like, trust and believe people who like them. VIII. People often do things for other than the apparent reasons. IX. Even people of quality can be petty and small. X. Everybody wears a social mask, look beyond the mask to see the person. Life Law 2: You create your own experience [accept accountability/responsibility for your life] If you dig deep enough, you can always find your role in the problems (which can be wrong observation, not being clear about what you want, doing stuff or neglecting to do stuff). That is not to say thay you're to blame (you did not intend to hurt yourself, nor was it gross neglect). Also be aware that you choose your thoughts, and emotionally toxic thoughts can poison you. Especially write down and be conscious of your 'negative tapes' running through your head. [characters: porcupine: insulted by everything, paws up, king/queen of the forest. Posers (superficial and insecure) people eaters (control anyone), drama queen, victim, Einstein analyzers [tend to miss the practical point], conspirator gossip, yeah-but, scarlett O'Hara (deal with it tomorrow), the mask (trying to hide something in their lives), Jekyll-and-Hyde (unpredictable), goody-two-shoes (try to be as pure as posisble), perfecto, chicken little (a disaster is about to happen!), whiners (complain that the world is unfair/an ordeal), guiltmongers (use guilt as weapon). Your experience in general is not enriched or the quality of your life enhanced by saying 'no'. Some people, when bad things happen to them (Jennie being raped by her grandfather) start to label themselves as 'dirty' or 'rotten'. And new experiences are always uncomfortable, sometimes even painful and definitely scary, making people want to run away from them. McGraw used “What if”-questions: what if you were wrong? What if I would offer a soliution now, would you take it? Then ask for declaration/commitment: are you sick of this? Are you willing to stand up for yourself right now and declare your right to a better life? No matter what you have to do? [and forgive others to break your own bonds] Life law #3: People do what works. Identify the payoffs that drive your behaviour and that of others. Control the payoffs to control your life. Methods: either start behaving in ways that get you what your really want, or stop behaving in ways that get you what you don't want. [but McGraw admits that we do a lot on autopilot] Masochists: possibly due to abusive parents, who hit the child and then, overcome with guilt, comfort it? In general, a negative consequence or extinction (no reward anymore) can work to eliminate undesired behaviours. You need to identify the payoffs in your life. Note that longing for safety can also let you wind up at the sidelines. Monetary income, physical income, safety income, spiritual income, achievement income, social income. Sometimes a payoff wins because it simply is more immediate (safety versus companionship. So strength of payoff and term are both important. Life Law #4: You can't change what you don't acknowledge. Acknowledging the truth (as two pilots did not by sating 'what's wrong with this instrument') can be as vital as it is distasteful. There is a part in every one of us that is not pretty, not courageous, and not appealing. Life law #5: Life rewards action- the world could not care less about thought without action. Most people mostly regret not doing things.”The difference between winners and losers is that winners do things that losers don't want to do”. If you don't have, it's because you don't act. Personal/Relational/Professional/Familial/Spiritual actions (top 3-4 to do). Life doesn't reward quitting, you're the only one who does that. Are you paralyzed by fear? Setback or rejection you can deal with. It's normal to be anxious and afraid, but you can't be dominated by fear. You do not have the right to hide behind fear. You do not have the right to waste your gifts. You are cheating yourself, and you are cheating everyone your life could be touching. Life law #6: There is no reality, there is only perception. Identify the filters through which you view the world. [Men view taking out the garbage as a duty, women interpret it as an act of love]. Our filters determine how we will respond, and therefore, ultimately, how we will be responded to. Make allowance for the filter that you have (which is, be aware that your mind may be 'distorted' in certain ways). If people have other filters than us, they seem 'strange' to us. And usually we also make mistakes if we use assumptions which we don't test as true first. And our filters are most profoundly distorted when we look at ourselves! Limiting beliefs are especially important if we venture into new or challenging situations, and add towards the stress. Life law 7: life is managed, it is not cured. Being upset is more a function of one's expectations than of the particular circumstances. It may also help to see yourself as two persons, one being the life manager (which can be evaluated). You have to make deposits in the 'Eric-Wubbo Lameijer' account to prevent psychologica/energetic bankrupcy. Beware of “what if” questions (“what if my spouse leaves me?”). Most people who ask 'what-if' questions are the people who have never taken the trouble of answering them. Also beware of unfinished emotional business [EW: does McGraw here mean someone slowly getting in debt in your relational bank account or getting too tired because of accumulated negative emotions reducing your mental energy for self-restraint? Stop living reactivily, put your life on project status [EW – great scientists probably were naturally interested in science and were not that fearful – they might have been 'reactive' in that respect. But many did have a very strong work ethic…] The world is not to be feared, just managed.

Life reforms: [#Steel152] Life reforms usually take 5 or so attempts, with occasional fallbacks. Don't be hard on yourself for failures, they're to be expected.

Life satisfaction: [#Flourish13] Questionnaires asking for life satisfaction mostly measure present mood (70%), and only for a small part how well people judge their lives to be. [#Seligm227] Life satisfaction goes up with income, mood with increased tolerance in a nation.

LifeSkills Training: [#Redirect162] programme with self-management unit (what do I like to improve about myself, social skills). Also works against smoking, both by teaching true social norms (that acceptance of tobacco is declining), and by helping kids become more assertive.

Lifespan: [#NRC060114] Chimpanzees can become over 40 years of age; gorilla's become adults faster and die faster, likely because their life is much simpler, simpler ecological and social niche.

Light: [#NS070511] Blue light makes us more alert: we make fewer mistakes and are faster than if we're exposed to pure green light. [#NS301010] Blue light amplifies processing of emotion, whatever it is. [#NS080717TheLightWayToBetterBrainHealth] Having solid state light (lights that act like natural light) reduce depression and fatigue in stroke patients. Brighter light (SW light) also halves the treatment time for severe depresssion from 59 days to 29 days.

Liking: [#Hatt128] Many students will respond 'no' on the question of whether their teacher likes them. Usually teachers are stunned by this, and change their practices. [#SciOnlineLondon2011] Grant committees (and people?) prefer research that's easiest to understand. [#EW090313] People may like people who are most likely to be of aid in the future: main criterion is whether they like them (as persons, not as providers of sex, jobs, money or whatever), next to that the other person should be valuable (wealthy, attractive, high-status, knowledgeable, etc). A third factor is probably indebteness: if you did X a favour, X may be more willing to give you a favour back than other persons; is this one of the ways in which Franklin's trick worked? [#Influence168] Tupperware sells also because it's in the house of a friend (who gets part of the cut). “Endless chain”-method: like for informational interviews, you can ask people for referrals, the referral may find it harder to refuse since the request comes from a friend; refusing you would be like rejecting your friend. People are more swayed by physical appearance than by qualifications (at least in job interviews). Good grooming helps. Similarity can also be helpful (even claimed similarity) whether it is in clothes, hobbies, backgrounds, whatever. Similar body posture, mood and verbal style. “I like you” is very powerful, even false praise/flattery works. Familiar face or name will also produce liking, though exposure to someone under adverse conditions will lead to disliking [classroom!]. So school desegregration can decrease the liking for the other group, though it can improve the result of the minority. You can stoke conflict by separating people into groups and letting them compete, and resolve it by forcing people to cooperate (for example: common goals, like getting a bus unstuck), especially if the cooperation is rewarded with success. Jigsaw classroom (give everyone a piece of the puzzle, forcing students to communicate). Bearer of bad news-phenomenon. Similarly, a car is rated faster if an attractive female lies on it. Luncheon technique: you like something more as it is presented to you while eating. Sports = personal due to assocation, you root for your own group. We also associate ourselves with the successes of 'our' team, especially when we feel bad about ourselves and need an ego boost. Conversely, we may try to make the things we associate with successful (the stage mothers). Liking defense: do we like the salesperson unnaturally fast? And separate seller from product while deciding. [#EW] Do kids and adults imitate others not only as 'learning method' but also to increase the amount that others like them? (though too obvious following may be counterproductive/annoying). [#EW] Adventure schools may get greater effect over time as cooperation increases liking for classmates and perhaps through that a more positive atmosphere at school. [#Nass54] If people don't like you, thet don't care how competent you are, they will not describe you positively to others or reward you for your competence. [#Nass66] If you like someone, you also like things associated with that person more. [#Nass193] Liking (or at least similarity) is more important than perceived competence: Americans trust an American accent more as a guide to Stockholm than a Swedish accent. Perhaps unless people use the central route (system 2) instead of the peripheral route (system 2). [#Nass198] Liking decreases as people find something incongruent, for example an Asian-looking person with an Australian accent. [##NS160917ChatbotLearnsApyFacialExpressions] Humans prefer speaking with robots that mimic their own facial expression.

Limen: [#Eyse180] There is not really a point below which a stimulus becomes invisible to the conscious; the chance of detecting it slowly reduces to randomness.

Limit: [#Ster234] The highest performers (at least musicians and writers) seem to work close to their limit (after all, they need extra sleep too).

Limitations: [#Seth120] Planck assumed some laws and limitations to resonators and such – like Einstein did while postulating that no object could exceed the speed of light. Interestingly, such limitations may enhance creativity or make advances possible.

Lindau: [#AnnelienZweemer] 5-6 days, lots of young scientists from MSc to postdoc. Annelien was very enthusiastic when she came back {EW: seeing the reward, or being infected with enthusiasm?] Most laureates discussed their current research, which they were enthusiastic about/fascinated by [EW: obvious: good scientists have highest interest for current research] Nobelists need thick skin (people told Crutzen that he was insane). Didn't let other people stop them. Followed their curiosity. One did research on his birthday (apparently, experiments performed on one's birthday are not destined to succeed) {EW: apparently had multiple short experiments. Olivier Smithies asked others for help. Not all Nobelists liked their new-found role as oracles.

Linking: [#Hatt259] effective elementary teachers engage most students consistently in activities that require them to think as they read, write and discuss. {EW: so linking? Or fuller activation of working memory/higher cognitive load? Or metacognition instead of rote?}

Lipski, Don: [#Robi110] Had lots of ' nervous energy' as a kid, and was always creating things. Loved his art teacher at high school for teaching him welding, but didn't see himself as an artist. Did have a very inspiring pottery teacher in his university minor. Visited all art departments at Cranbrook, read everything about art he could catch, etc.

Listening: [#SellHuman189] Listening is a rare skill, consider developing it. Most doctors interrupt patient in first 18 second of speaking time, missing valuable information. [15 seconds before answering?] Have one 'slow' day in which you wait 5 seconds before responding. [#ToastmasterDec2009SpeakingToChildren] Whereas adults usually speak 160-170 words per minute, 5-7 year old kids can only process about 124 words per minute. [#Catmul168] It was Cassandra’s audience who were really cursed because they would not listen to her (and died because of it). Bosses often need to actively dig for problems / ask people. You need to know the unseen and understand its nature, or you will be ill-prepared to lead.

Literature: [#ChemWint06] Some teachers spend many hours reading subject literature to keep their knowledge up-to-date. [#Weiner52] Achievement themes in literature correlate to real-world achievement in a society.

Lithium: [#NS25022012] Lithium seems to help fix nerves/thicken myelination sheaths.

Little and often: [#Fors19] Third principle: try to do things in short bursts over a longer time period.

Little bets: [#Newport179] Many successful innovators don't have a great business plan, they make a methodical series of little bets, learning critical information from many failures and some small but significant wins. [#Schmid218] For companies, little bets are dangerous; “we can survive if this product is merely good” does not engender top creativity or effort.

Live (instruction): Is as effective as technology-based (internet, conferencing). Learning is mainly determined by how well the message has been designed, not by the exact medium.

Living: [#EW] Living, for a part, is learning what the rules are. Not everything is in the manual.

Load reduction: [#McCo821] The best programmers reduce the strain on their brains by using problem-domain concepts, short routines, and decomposing the problem (and are humble enough to encourage walkthroughs and inspections).

Loading time: [#Kluw233] To switch tasks, one needs to load the rules of the other task into working memory; getting a clear cue on what to do makes this loading unnecessary {EW: and would when things are automated loading times also be reduced by much, as retrieval may be much faster?} If someone needs to get the correct cue, internal articulation may be needed to coordinate {and in chimps? They can't whisper...}. Cues can be automatic and conscious by internal articulation.

Location: [#Imagine176[ David Byrne moved to Manhattan to be close to the rock scene, and went over the river to absorb the music in the latin dance clubs. [#182] Cheap rents encourage a diversity of residents. Risky, arty, small-scale business too. Proximity of all those overlapping minds. [#Hargit94] Many people who were at the right place at the right time have done a lot of moving around before they arrived at the right place. Pople, for example, moved there (to the right place).

Loci: [#EricB541] The method of loci is one of the oldest memory methods, and still used by memorizers (often in combination with transforming numbers into words or dates or running times or whatever is meaningful). Can be substitued by a story, but less reliable since the structure is neither permanent nor already known.

Locus of control: [#Wiki] The degree in which someone believes that he or she can control the events in ones life (may differ per particular area, though! And effect is also moderated by value given to, for example, health). If locus is more external, people are more vulnerable to stress and depression. Stability-instability and globality-specificity are related scales, see also explanatory style. {EW explanatory style would be very Dweck-like}[#Pers150] The locus of control is who you blame for your lot -can be internal (blaming yourself) or external (blaming others). Research seems to indicate that defensive externalism can be the best mindset for success (perhaps because in most cases people are not judged on their competence but on their confidence?)

Loneliness: [#NS220717AloneInTheCrowd] Loneliness arises from mismatch between expectations of our social interactions and the reality; a lonely person can be lonely even in a crowd. Lonely people are at increased risk of heart attacks, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer (and generally about every major chronic illness). Effect about as big as that of obesity, smoking, alcohol or inactivity (odds of early mortality by 26%, is similar to obesity). Loneliness reduces willpower. Activity of inflammation-genes is ramped up, part of flight-or-fight response, ‘conserved transcriptional response to adversity’, default immune system, which protects us from viruses, damped down, so immune system can shift towards better response to bacterial infection (like after a fight with a tiger). Inflammation also affects the brain, making it a bit more suspicious, vigilant and irritable. Brains tune in to social threats faster. Inflammation also dampens down brain activity related to motivation to interact with others. Loneliness may be part of biological warning mechanism, like hunger, as we lived in groups for amongst other protection. Loneliness is increasing as fewer young people are in romantic relationships. People need about 5 close friends and family, and dedicate about 40% of their social time to them. Loneliness also makes people more likely to sleep badly, feel tired and have trouble concentrating during the day. Loneliness best fought by cognitive behavioral training; feeling less threatened helps interactions with others. Sense of purpose and meaning in life can also help overcome negative effects of loneliness. Note that different people need different amounts of social contact.

Long-term perspective: [#Newport98] Steve Martin considered that if he stayed with the banjo for forty years, he'd become pretty good at it. [#Shivan Subramaniam/Adam Bryant] S's former boss always took a long-term view, would be very measured, whether it was good news or bad news. [#Weiner76] People who see themselves as doing something long-term learn much faster and remember better (remember McPherson).

Long-term potentiation: [#Medi134] Induced by a teacher neuron firing first. But if the teacher neuron doesn't fire for a long time after that, the student neuron resets to the default state.

Long-term working memory: [#Colv101] Getting at the long-term memory in a fast, reliable way. People think that it may be that information is linked to its meaning in LTM, making it meaningful and easier to remember {EW: arsenic = toxic, Napoleon, old people killer, rat poison?} [#EricB54] {may be that activating one data point in the LTM activates relevant links subconsciously, so that the appropriate knowledge is primed and ready to activate when needed} [#EricB600] More resistant to interruptions than normal working memory, and also stores things long-term {EW: LTWM was how the physicist could resume work after an interruption? Or perhaps primed by cue?}

Longing: [#Franzen208] Would there be a difference between a need and a longing? In any case, fulfilling a longing often leads to boredom, and seeking new objects of longing, leading to (short term) consumer's euphoria when obtaining it.

Looks: [#Int300911] Under American lawyers, beautiful people earn 10-12% more, but only handsome males get higher starting salaries.

Lorentz, Hendrik: [#Crop207] Was both creative theorist as sympathetic critic to many young physicists, though he did not gather a flock of research students. Was able to bring harmony to the great physics conferences he organized: great tact, unsurpassed knowledge, his ability to summarize lucidly the most tangled arguments, and his matchless linguistic skill.

Losada ratio: [#Flourish66] Companies need at least 2.9 positive to negative statements, marriages 5:1. Over 13:1 is not good, however. [EW: Losada ratio is criticized, based on fluid dynamics. Why? It should be straightforward?]

Loss: [#EW] You can't easily handle loss with doing nothing or relaxing: you may need an intense diversion that demands your full attention, such as Darwin's love for beetle collecting, or Fermi's burying himself in physics after his brother died. [#Lyubom166] It is usually good to try find some meaning in a loss. [#EW: even if it is nonsense, rationally speaking]

Loss aversion: [#Tigg110] People are 2-2.5 times as motivated by possible loss than by possible profit – problems can really be more motivating than “challenges”

Lotka's law: [#Simo/EW] Would Lotka's law exist not only because of differences in productivity/time management, but also because top scientists use idea juggling and perhaps collaboration to increase their output?

Love: [#Howe140] Einstein didn't make much progress in his musical studies, until at age 13 he suddenly developed a love for Mozart's sonatas. He later said that he so “discovered that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty – at least for me”{EW: similar to 'Clarissa', who only deliberately practiced music she was very interested in?} [#Ster300] People who did what they loved were more creative in their pursuits. [#Franzen251] Loving a person usually means that one desires his/her approval, warm affection, attachment. [#NS150214HowToFixABrokenHeart] Love is lust, attraction and attachment. Lust (obsessing over number of kisses in e-mail) – unusually low levels of serotonin transporter (like OCD). SSRIs can help (also make it harder to form romantic bonds). Blocking dopamine or oxytocin can remove attachment. Blocking CRF stops depressive behavoir over loss of mate. [#EW] Most people (and colleagues!) crave love, acceptance, and facebook friends. Being criticized, even for a job badly done, hurts them, as they identify themselves with their job and their tribe. So I probably should not seek out people who want to be loved as my superiors (or even equals!) [#KijkJan1993HettyRombouts] Love can be at first sight, but can also develop gradually, sometimes only falling in love after having had sex. Characteristic: thinking about that person, wanting to be with that person. Gradual development if you start finding each other ‘aardig’/nice? Or turn out to have same interests. Generally we fall in love with people of about our own level of attractiveness. Very important: we have to think there is a chance our love is responded to. Somber people and people with low self-confidence don’t fall in love as easily. “Actiebereidheid” is important (people have energy/desire to do something, to be close with the other person” [#HaidtH125] Passionate love cannot last – it is mainly a phase so people can stay together long enough for their attachment and caregiving systems to grow, ‘compassionate love’. Two main errors are to get committed while still ‘insane’ in love, or break it off when the passionate love fades and compassionate love is not strong enough yet. Passionate love works a bit like heroin/cocain, it releases lots of dopamine, if it is consumed too often (which happens if the love is not long-distance) neurons adapt in a few weeks or months at most, breaking the rose-colored glasses. If stopped, you get withdrawal symptoms; pain, lethargy and despair.

Loved-one technique: [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczT-GYJ9wY&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=6] Imagining how a loved one would want you to develop, what possibilities he or she sees for you.

Lovelace, Ada: [#Isaac9] Had poetic and insubordinate temperament (O+N). Manic depressions? (at least occasional illusions of grandeur). Maths was also for self-protection against emotions? Had writer Mary Sommerville as kind of role model. Had poor health – saw task as daughter of Lord Byron. Visualized. Slight megalomania / confidence in pursuit. Babbage suggested Ada to add notes to her translation of the lecture. Ada also wrote lots of letters – at least to her mother.

Loyalty: [#Lieb30] Loyalty can be increased with 'bribes' (giving people a certain position), or by showing them that you are doing great, sacrificing for others since you do what you think is right <EW: making clear that you can make them successful too).

LSD: [C2W200516VervaagdeGrenzen] If you use LSD over multiple sessions, new brain connections are formed. In general use, LSD makes brain parts communicate that do not usually communicate in adults (and the other way around). [#NS170617LeadingTheHighLife] James Fadiman found in the 1960s that giving LSD to engineers, mathematicians and architects made them perform better on test and reported finding the process helpful to the creative process. Most effects of LSD and psylocibi are from binding to the serotonin receptors responsible for mood and cognition. Also allows visual cortex communicate more with other areas. Microdosing (10x less) seems to help against depression, but not so much against anxiety. More determined, active, alert, proud and enthusiastic, but also more nervous and jittery. Less depressed, upset, guilty and afraid. One person reported becoming more extroverted (social anxiety diminishes?) but less concentrated for solo work.

LTD: [#Kluw247] Long-term depression. Occurs if neuron B is already activated when neuron A fires at it. LTD requires less intracellular Ca2+, LTP more!

LTP: [#Wolt25] Long-term potentiation. Neurons in the hippocampus, after being activated, become extra sensitive for further activation for a very long time. [#Kluw65] Two phases; the first (E-LTP) (after one train of stimuli) does not invoke RNA synthesis, is just changing some proteins, increasing intracellular calcium, and making the neuron more responsive to further signals. Lasts for minutes. Second LTP (L-LTP) (caused by multiple trains) can last for hours, involves RNA synthesis and synaptic growth.

Lucid dreaming: [#NS241211] Your skills (at least motoric skills) improve if you practice them in a lucid dream. Lucid dreaming also helps to cope with trauma; lucid dreamers are psychologically healthier. [practice lucid dreaming: make it a habit of questioning reality by day; note down dreams after waking up, plan dream before going to sleep, do high-concentration task during the day, like playing a musical instrument [wake up early, get out of bed, back under covers ]

Luck: [#Robi161] According to the research of Richard Wiseman, lucky people differ in four respects from unlucky people. First, they are very good at utilizing random chances. Second, they listen to their intuition and do things like meditation to strengthen their intuition. Third, they expect to be lucky. Fourth, they are not defeated by adversity but act quickly to get a bad situation back under control. [An unlucky person did not perceive a 5-dollar bill lying on the ground and did not initiate talk to a stranger] [#Wise12] Luck seems also to depend on meeting many people (so going to different places to meet diverse people) and contacting them/daring to push contacts further (Herzberg talking to a stranger). Sometimes 'bad luck' forces people to do research and find a better opportunity (like for Warren Buffett). And knowing things; Helzberg knew who Warren Buffett was, and that he might be interested in buying his company. 50% of people report themselves as consistently lucky, 16% as consistently unlucky. [#Wise22] Passion for X-> research into X-> contact with people in X-> thinking about what would help people in X-> jobs? Also it may be a factor that lucky people filter out the bad things that happened to them in their life; unlucky people (like depressed people) filter out the good things. Possibly people also attract/are attracted to people who are like them, which can spell trouble for unlucky people. They may also be more fun/easier to be around with, making for better relationships, and have keener intuition/social knowledge, which helps them avoid bad relationships. Bad luck also possible by not paying attention/having poor motor skills/being absent-minded? Lucky people also talk to other people about their passion. Confidence can help; lucky people were much more confident that they'd win the lottery than unlucky people, while their chance was actually the same. Some 'lucky' people depend on the law of numbers, enter many competitions for example.Wiseman distinguishes four factors. One is personality, subfactors extraversion, neuroticism, and openness. Extraversion: lucky people meet more other people + chat more with them, are more approachable (open body language, smiling, eye contact) and are more 'collectors' of people. Neuroticism: by being anxious or preoccupied with something, you miss opportunities which are out there. Some lucky people also consciously strive to do new things, like talking only to people in a black suit. Second main factor: lucky people listen to their gut feelings and take time to meditate or reflect. Unlucky people do that much more rarely. Third factor: lucky people expect good things to happen to them, unlucky people expect a bleak future. [Though lucky persons also tend to look on the bright side of life, even if things seem to be going all wrong] Part of it is also 'filtering out' good or bad experiences to make a mental image of complete luck, or complete 'bad luck'. Lucky people are also more persevering in their goals, and even make attempts if chances of success seem slim. Also persevere in the face of failure, have faith that things will work out in the end. But they generally don't get overconfident. Also expect their interactions with others to be lucky and successful (often rooted in positive experiences in one's youth [EW: +interaction log?]). Finally, their give a positive twist to their negative experience (it could have been much worse) instead of giving a negative twist (if that wouldn't have happened at all, I would have been much happier). Wiseman calls that counterfactual thinking, though I personally am not sure if that is the correct term. They also think that any ill fortune may work out for the best, they can analyze what has gone wrong and try to improve it, and try to think of creative solutions to tackle the same problem. Unlucky people are reluctant to learn from their mistakes. They are also much more superstitious than lucky people. [#NS250812] There are serendipity apps, that encourage you to go to new places, like GetLostBot. [#Wisem204] Lucky people are attracted to people with similar luck profiles (equally intuitive, for example), unlucky people not. Luck may also be partly desire (I want this) and discuss that desire with others, like Joseph who needed a certain book and talked with another student about it, and got it for free.

Lucrativity: [#Levi102] How lucrative a job is perceived to be (fame, wealth, mates, status) also influences how many people will try to get it.

Luxury: [#CoyleT15] Would luxurious training surroundings signal to the mind that the situation is comfortable and  that they do not need to take action?

Lynne (Gillian): [#Robi17] A girl that couldn't sit still, but her psychologist discovered that she loved moving to music, and convinced her mother to send her to dancing school.

Lyubomirsky: [#Hobbelt] Happiness researcher.

M-talent: [#EW/#Simon2013Int45] In contrast to cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence and the like (can agreeableness, M be separeted from intelligence)  dispositional traits include personality, values and interests (interests to personal interests).

Ma, Yo-Yo: [#Imagine88] Pretends that he is the host of a dinner party; but like Julia Child does not want to seem worried. Welcomes first mistake.

MAC/FAC-model: [#Ster355] a model that posits that superficial features are most useful for getting information out of long-term memory, but that deeper features are compared when two items are in working memory {EW: may the superficial features, for non-experts, simply be more salient?}

MACH: [#NS130713] My Automated Conversation Coach; will give feedback in mock interview on how your technique is.

Mach: [#Pers81] Unit in psychology for manipulativeness or machiavellianism – High Mach or Low Mach. High Mach persons always look at situations and wonder what person the situation calls for. High Machs are unconcerned with morals and whether they like people <EW: sociopaths?> and can lie through their teeth, and therefore have an advantage if others cannot check the truth of what they say. Manipulation also makes sense in a world of strangers, where you are unlikely to have long-term relationships with others. Could be caused of unstable youth, though of course having high-Mach parents WOULD create an unstable youth too, so genes may be predominant here. Females and feminine-men often use false self-disclosure and lure, men argue and intimidate (if things do not go as I say...) Playing for more time is usually a great tactic against manipulators, as repeated exposure to them tends to unmask them. A good manipulator tends to hide the threat he poses... [#Zill79] Scoring high on the 'deceit' subscale of machiavellianism (desire to break social norms, or see others break them) correlates well with preference for horror movies.

Machines: [#Greene83] Would working with machines help you (like Ford) become a more practical problem-solver? Perhaps because in machines, all consequences have causes, and if you know the cause, you can fix it. Failures show you inherent flaws and how to improve it.

MACR: [#EricB52] 'Moderately Abstracted Conceptual Representation' – the kind of abstractions that experts use to solve problems.

Magazines: [#Tonn96] Getting on TV can be great, but in any case try to get into the magazines of the entertainment press – they are read by TV makers, casting bureaus and businessmen alike, and you may be able to get 'klusjes' or further contacts/experience/fame.

Magnetic middle: [#Gold24] People try to behave averagely, which even means that people behaving exceptionally well by themselves will be motivated to deteriorate. Can be prevented by strongly approving the desired behaviour.

Maintenance: [#EricB734] Some basic skills can be maintained by normal 'experience', but for most advanced skills one needs deliberate practice to keep in shape. [#Lyubom65] It is important to actively maintain one's marriage.

Maintenance rehearsal: [#Clar205] Maintenance rehearsal (rote repetition) does not build mental models, and does not produce much learning until things are repeated hundreds of times (after which they become automatic). If something does not need to become automated, elaborative rehearsal is better.

Making things: [#Root03] A good predictor of creativity is if individuals, as a child, made things with hands and mind.

Managers: [#Int261012] Managers who have mastered several styles of leading (being directive, letting people free) are most effective [EW: like teachers] [#GoogleProjectOxygen] Good managers do 8 things: 1. Be a good coach. 2. Empower; don't micromanage. 3. Be interested in direct reports, success and well-being. 4. Don't be a sissy: Be productive and results-oriented. 5. Be a good communicator and listen to your team. 6. Help your employees with career development. 7. Have a clear vision and strategy for the team. 8. Have key technical skills so you can advise the team. Pitfalls: 1. Have trouble making a transition to the team. 2. Lack a consistent approach to performance management. 3. Spend too little time managing and communicating.

Mania: [#Simo103] May be conductive to encourage creators to work hard and see themselves able to create “magnum opi” [#Burn27] May be the opposite of depression, with greater aggression and sexual appetite, and vastly increased self-confidence. <EW: probably caused by biology instead of thoughts>

Manners: [#NS210913] Manners might show good hygiene (useful!) and putting the interest of others for themselves (so good cooperators). Less 'manners' for friends, perhaps because already established cooperative relationship.

Manson, Lamar: [#Robi99] Also known as 'Black Ice', had a mother who encouraged him to write about everything, whenever he had problems, was happy or afraid; his friends later asked him to write letters for them. Most important for him is to have a message to tell.

Mantra: [#Loeh91] Having a mantra for a situation that you habitually deal poorly with (such as “Kindness matters” when confronted with incompetence) may help. [#NS240617TryAPowerPose] Mantras seem to promote brain activity that has a calming effect.

Manturzewska: [#EricB458] Did research on the background of successful Polish musicians.

Maoa-gene: [#C2W2011] Men with MAOA-L made more risky (and more successfully risky) decisions than those with MAOA-H.

Maps and tables: [#Watt188] Maps and tables can sometimes help memory much more than mere words.

Marginal contents: [#Mill38] Making a brief abstract of each paragraph to judge the structure of the work.

Marginality: [#Ster329] Being marginal makes one more likely to challenge the status quo and be creative (just like young, unestablished people – they have less to lose). [#Simo123] Marginality can help creativity -either ethnical marginality (immigrants, Jews/bilinguists), religious marginality (other faith) or professional marginality (switching fields). Professional maginality however differs from ethnic marginality because its creators usually have only one noteworthy idea.

Marijuana: [#NRC080211] Use of marijuana doesn't cause more psychoses, it however causes them 2.5 years earlier in sensitive people. [Openness/marijuana?]

Market research: [#Tonn79] To be successful in a field, you need to research the 'market' as well. What is changing? What seems to be lacking?

Market Venn diagram: you love, you can, people want. Also for companies: you like the problem, you can solve it, there is a market. Note that you can understand it as a system: there is another system, you can put in what you can do, and you get out what you want [like money, or exciting jobs]

Marketing: [#McGraw23] Often the most pleasant/alluring/politically correct message is spread, instead of something that works. [#Schmid236] Google only starts marketing in earnest after they had some small successes, ‘soft opening’. Don’t feed the losers. “We’ll outmarket them” seldom a good approach.

Marriage and children: [#Simo220] Marriage and children are bad for a woman's productivity, much more so than for men. [#Pers24] In fact, the productivity of male scientists usually briefly peaks after marriage, and unmarried scientists peak later and show a slower decline in productivity.

Marshmallow test: [#NS/EW] How well children can resist eating a marshmallow in exchange for a later reward predicts success later in life.

Maslow: [#Hofste189] Maslow’s model may lack need for respect, harmony, face, and duty.

Mass media: [#Granovetter] People rarely act on mass-media information unless it is also transmitted through personal ties.

Mass production: [#Int] It is stupid that so many buildings are tailor-made, it costs a lot in design. Getting something mass-produced is far more efficient [and science?]

Massed practice: [#EricB506] Massed practice leads to better short-term learning (acquisition phase), spaced practice for better long-term learning, both on intellectual skills as in perceptual-motor skills (which are quite similar) {EW: must really read more about this! Seems important, but book is unclear!}. Also, reality is more 'random' than blocked, so massed training seems to give lower generalization of skills. Only exception is at minimal levels of practice; then blocked practice is more useful than random practice! {may be because optimal learning seems to involve the first items without interfering elements in between, and then increasing the number of interfering elements between subsequent tests}

Masters: [#Greene116] Masters have suffered to get where they are, they suffered enless criticisms of their work, doubts about their progress, setbacks along the way. Ask them to give you proper challenges that will reveal your strengths and weaknesses and gain as much feedback as possible.

Mastery: [#Bloo485] Pianists made the progress from playing for adoration to playing for mastery, to doing things really well and derive satisfaction from that, or just by being better than others. {EW: Being good at something is good for one's identity, perhaps?} [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y ] To get better and better in something that matters. [#PinkDrive117] Desire for mastery (desire for intellectual challenge, to master something new and engaging) predicts more patents than desire for money, even when controlled for effort. [#Flourish187] Rats die sooner if they experienced learned helplessness, later if they experience mastery (being able to control the environment). [#191] Mastery also decreases death from CVD in people. [#Seligm185] Perhaps mastery is 'what I do influences the environment/I am not better able to control the environment [#EW: can we make an exercise to pay attention to learning/achievement against depression?]

Mastery learning: [#Bloo4] Mastery learning, which means that a child needs to master a task before advancing to a new task, makes the average student surpass 85% of students under conventional instruction. [#EricB79 for references on how it worked] [#Hatt171] Very good effects, though decreasing from elementary school (d=0.94) to university level (d=0.65). Positive effects on both cognitive and affective outcomes. Especially effective for low-aptitude students.

Material conditions: [#Parr12] Without decent housing and food, quality of one's study suffers.

Materialism: [#Pers6] The con trick of materialism is that it makes us think that working hard and accumulating material possessions will get us attention - but most of us are doomed to be average, and charity/selfless work would be a much better road to our goals. Materialism is also a personality trait, like extraversion; materialistic people seem to focus on possessions, belief that possessions enhance happiness, and define success on material possessions. Often caused by childhood experiences which made people feel insecure and/or not close to others (such as financial hardship or cold and controlling parents). [#EW: same goes for working hard and becoming famous will give us attention/happiness. If we want to be noticed and valued by other beings, charity seems to offer a better chance] [#Weiner117] Our age may not be genuinely materialistic as we have no respect for material, for respect is based on wonder.

Math students: [#Csik141] Math students seem relatively less intrinsically motivated than other talented students. {EW: abstractness of math? Or does one need less knowledge or motivation to be good at math at highschool, as math involves relatively little learning and a decent intelligence may be enough}

Mathematicians: [#Eyse14] None of the 'genius'-level mathematicians seemed to have a mathematically trained father {EW: can maths be the exception? Or is a bit of education/middle class enough?} [#Bloo271] Most were male, and 60% were eldest or only child. Parents were generally well-educated, and considered education and achievement (especially intellectual achievement) as very important values. Parents did not try to direct their children's careers. Working hard, doing well, being precise {detail!?}were the values the parents did not often tell, but lived. Children were not treated childishly, always talked to as if they were thinking individuals (nursery school teacher - evolution). Parents were often role models (one child tried to type a book just like his father did) Parents read a lot to their children. As children, they had great curiosity, and their parents responded by answering seriously and encouraged asking even more questions. Children were able to focus on complex tasks for longer periods, alone. Parents tried to avoid teaching their children to read, as it might interfere with their school (in one case though, the young mathematician, impatiently enough, learned himself to read). They had discussions though on chemistry, astronomy and all things sciency. First parents answered their questions, later they found materials to answer those questions for their children; still later they let the children look things up on their own. Good teachers encouraged children to research the question, instead of just giving the answer {EW: but in the beginning they answered a lot?} Most parents felt their children were brilliant though, especially after IQ-tests. 75% spent lots of time reading as a kid, while they read rather indiscriminately. Many did lots of model building, and as realistically as possible. Some parents sent their kids to repair shops to see how things worked. School was generally not felt as a very positive or educational experience, though many felt socially isolated. Later, they tried to get the books, one even wrote the dean of a local university to ask to use the library. They did many experiments at home. Most teachers were rather ordinary (good ones let the kids work independently or even gave them their own college textbooks), but some teachers really seemed to know what they were doing and were able to transmit the love of research. Maths contests encouraged and challenged them. Peers were important, at least the rare ones who loved science too. In college, most followed both colleges in their normal choice (like chemistry) and mathematics, then drifted towards maths. Were chosen for honours programs, had some inspiring teachers, some with showmanship, clarity, or a taste for interesting problems. Some stopped playing and started working really hard at maths. Chose good (well, great) graduate schools. Also stress that they had luck sometimes, by being in the right field just as it was broken open by a discovery. Some had role model, like grandfather. {EW: parents of mathematicians seemed much less extraverted and 'organizers'/committee members than the parents of the neurologists}

Mathematics: [#EricB554] When mathematical thinking is taking place, the left angular gyrus and intraparietal sulci are activated – damage to these areas impairs mathematical ability. While mathemathical ability is partly dependent on IQ and many good mathematicians also have success in law and other intellectual fields, it's not always the case: some people have a good IQ and rather mediocre mathematical ability, others have average or below-average IQ, but excel in at least calculating (the strongest case of which are idiots-savants). {EW: distinguish mathematicians from calculators?} [#EricB561] Calculators were often obsessed by numbers {EW: and mathematicians?} [#?] If teachers let children 'discover' mathematical principles, and allow kids to doubt or discuss, and trust they can find 'new and amazing' solutions, creates a 'mathematical community'. (6-year olds) [#Blote, van de rBurg, Klein, Journal of Eudcational Psych, Sep 2011] When choosing to either teach one method, practice it and then other methods for addition, better to let children first, supervised, think of tricks. Last option is better, otherwise children will still choose for first-learned solution, even if it is not the best one. [#Adams4] Is one thinking mode, next to verbalizing or imagery. [#PISA2012] Netherlands has ascended in maths, because other nations have fallen more than NL in maths performance [EW: why falling grades?] [#NS020917Our greatest creation: Where maths comes from and what it’s for] Normal people use the same regions when thinking about problems in algebra, geometry and topology and for everyday thinking; mathematicians use different regions, a ‘math network’ which does not overlap with brain reghions involved in language (so they don’t think about it in normal language).

Mating priming: [#NS191209] If mating-primed, both sexes are marginally more likely to do socially prestiguous volunteering (arranging white house meeting with charity officials) but only the men (and the mostly the promiscuous men) increased in socially dominant pro-social behaviour (leading a dangerous protest, giving a speech for a hostile crowd) High-promiscuity men are also more likely to borrow fashionable clothes from a friend to impress a potential mate, low-promis rather impress the boss; women show no difference. High-promis spend more money on visible luxury goods, but only when primed for short-term relationships. Women find car in which man drives important, but only for short-term relationships, not marriage: car reflects good genes, resources are not that important. Mating-primed men would spend more of a windfall on luxuries than men who are not primed; women show no difference but increase their volunteering if they are mating-primed. [though they may just give the socially desirable/attractive answer]

Matrix: [#Coyl178] Master coaches have 'the matrix', extensive experience in teaching (they are mostly older) so they can see where the student's sweet spots are, and how to access them. An example is Linda Septien, who studied for years what worked and didn't work in music, to know what each student lacked and what approach he or she needed.

Matrix method: [#G&E040214] A method in which kids are taught to visualize their fears or anger, and destroy it or lock it up. [EW: alternative to cognitive therapy?] Ingrid Stoop/Brigitte Pijselman

Matsuoka, Yuki: [#Greene111] Mentor Rodney Brooks: unconventional dared challenge higher-ups as well as entrenched ideas in AI. Spent as much as time as possible around him, soaking up his style of thinking, even though he let students do their own stuff, just support them when you needed it.

Matthew effect: [#EWL/Howe129] George Bidder started his career as arithmetical prodigy probably accidentally by his own interest, but got so much encouragement (and halfpence) that he subsequently focused his efforts. Small differences in initial circumstances can lead to big differences in the end; a slightly younger child may find his learning discouraged and sinks even deeper. And it is possible that someone is considered a 'talent' by just starting his training a tad earlier.

Maximizers: [#NS050507] Maximizers seek the best option out of an array of choices, in contrast to “satisficers” who are happy enough with something that is 'good enough'. Maximizers especially seem to be paralyzed with having many choices. [#HaidtH102] Maximizers are also more likely to perform social comparison, and feel especially depressed when others do better.

Maxwell, James Clerk: [#Crop154] Maxwell was a kind of magician, depending on analogies between phenomena to get started, and then removing the analogies as scaffolding when he had finished. Had the patience and tenacity Thomson lacked; had long papers! Father was sensitive, cautious and unconventional; mother more decisive and blunt. Mother died when James Clerk was eight years old, though he took it quite stoically. Could be obstinate against drilling tutor. Tutor mistreated him, which father didn't notice (and may have made JC more shy in life than necessary), but decisive aunt dragged him to Edinburgh for a good education, though he was initially quite tormented at school due to his clothes and accent {and he may also have been a bit geekish by himself}. Loved puns, hoaxes, mirror writings and riddles. {EW: feverish creativity seeking an outlet?} Was not a prodigy, but father's interest in science and technology led him to take his son to all kinds of scientific meetings in Edinburgh, and at age 14 JCM published his first paper, on a new construction method for ovals. Worked on theory of electromagnetism for about 20 years in intervals, but claimed the ideas ripened in the meantime. Had two mentors: Forbes who was a supreme experimentalist, Hamilton who emphasized that models were necessary to get to the truth. After Edinburgh, Maxwell went to the mecca of mathematics, Cambridge. Was trained by the most renowned private tutor, William Hopkins. Maxwell had mass of knowledge already, but still unordered. Was quite eccentric at Cambridge, used to exercise at 2 AM! Was horrible teacher (too rapid and creative thinker), but model for clarity of writing. Was not the best teacher, but supreme as inspiration. Aberdeen was a bit dullish place, but then went to London. But after a while discovered that he had enough independent means to survive without a job, and focus on his research fulltime, and went to Glenlair. Was happy there, though perhaps less productive than in London. Used idea that Faraday wrote in correspondence to try out what happened if forces are not instantaneous. Also used the Lagrangian mathematics. Also researched lots of other topics next to electromagnetism, such as gas theory, thermodynamics, color vision and Saturn's rings. Stressed the importance of fusing experimental and theoretical science; we must first get familiar with a phenomenon, then study what we can measure about it, how to measure them, and deduce from the measurements the result we'd want to find. 'There is no more powerful method for introducing knowledge into the mind than of presenting it in as many different ways as we can' {EW: far transfer!} Also ability to switch from theory to practice and back again. Appreciated Cavendish's purity of purpose and indifference to recognition. Was generous, and one of the least self-centered scientists, with Gibbs. Religiously rather conventional, and his sociological views were rather feudal (which was quite natural in that time), but believed deeply, probably saw in science a way to find the mind of God. [#Jaffe203] Was 'only' number 2 at the maths exam, like JJ Thomson later. [#Seth66] Maxwell had lots of correspondence with William Thomson.

May, Karl: [AO2185] Was blind until age 5, grandmother read him stories. Had vivid imagination, but also stole and used fake identities (sociopathic?); needed quiet to write.

Mayer, Robert: [#Crop52] Was a scientific outsider, like Carnot, independent and anti-authoritative. Stubborn and sensitive to criticism (went on hunger strike when suspended from university). Didn't like to follow the prescribed course (didn't go into regular medical practice, but sailed as a ship's doctor to the East Indies), but there was inspired by his original observation that venous blood was redder in the tropics, which gave him a new feeling of intellectual stimulation and excitement. Also made leaps to physical and chemical principles from these. Was proud, but also very persevering when his first paper was rejected! Did suffer a breakdown and mental crisis though, and deliberately avoided all scientific activity for about 10 years.

McCartney (Paul): [#Robi23] Paul McCartney didn't study much, he spent most of his time at home listening to pop music or on his guitar lessons. Met John Lennon and formed a band. Did NOT enjoy music lessons at school (teacher just let them listen to dusty old classical music) {EW: stuffing the geese?}. Was refused by the Liverpool Cathedral choir since he didn't sing well enough.

Mean world effect: [#NS210407] People feel more vulnerable after seeing images of bad situations.

Meaning: [#EricB50] Experts most often configured their chess configurations in memory in terms of threat or opportunity; so linked the information to relevant factors. [#Laird24] A symbol, such as a word, does not have one isolated meaning, but is more like a cloud of stronger and weaker associations {EW: for example school being a building, a period of your life, something to do with learning, or with traditional classes}. This web of meanings is defined/reinforced by society, though it probably also leaves room to individual interpretation and extension. [#Franzen259] Meaninglessness occurs when there is no attachment to something larger than the lonely self. [#Foer62] Experts perceive patterns with meaning, or meaning in patterns, which strengthens memory. [#NS031211] We store/retrieve memories based on meaning => we can recall the gist, perhaps that is also why chessplayers have such great memories for chess positions: their recollection is deep with meaning. [#Will155] Meaning seems to have a cognitive life on its own, seemingly independent from sensory details. [#http://www.intermediair.nl/magazine/20150226/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2015wk09&utm_campaign=iw&e=1&m_i=OalOnTgtPBeTUpgX6jeQilpOV6O2kZlrtalc5pczbJb0EdV4H8smXbPYKpLa1y%2B5qiRUpqDDL_91FLKjIGT0TdkKkyrqx#3 ] Women may require impact and purpose in their work more than men, who can love fancy new technology for its own sake. [#EW] Is meaning internalized pride? [#Stalla51] Meaning can also be created by being an innovator, setting a challenging goal, communicate your identity up front and contintue communicating (including highlighting/rewarding value-congruent behavior) [#HaidtH229] Meaning automatically occurs when people are coherent (values, community; body, mind, community; traits, coping mechanisms, and life story)

Means: [#Gall41] Many tennis players try to focus on the 'means' (how they hit the ball) too much, and neglect to pay attention to the ends (whether the ball does well in court). {EW: this may work best if there are basically good habits already in place} [#Lieb19] The fastest way to change someone is convincing him or her that the means he is employing do not lead him to his goal.

Measurements: [SimonB4] Measurements in science, for example Galton's, often suffered either from inaccuracy (or even being qualitative instead of quantitative, like visual imagery) or from irrelevance (highest pitch heard is not related to genius). Improvement in technology helps...

Measuring behaviour: [#Tigg214] Measuring behaviour is only beneficial if the results are used as the basis for positive reinforcement.

Medawar, Peter: Stressed 'art of the soluble'.

Medical expertise: [#EricB341] Medical expertise does not lie in better problem solving algorithms, but in more and better-organized knowledge on a particular group of diseases. Basic science does not help in simple cases, but is very useful when there is extraneous data.

Meditation: [#EWL] Would meditation enhance creativity? {Possibly because of lower arousal. Gallwey claims that the mind should be as quiet as the surface of a glass lake.. The flow? When in love?} May work because it trains the willpower (dragging thoughts back to the main subject} [#NS15102011] Meditation increase bodily awareness, which increases your sensitivity for bodily hunches. [http://www.frontiersin.org/Cognition/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00116/full] Open awareness meditatie vergroot divergent denken, maar niet convergent denken. Focused attention meditatie helpt noch divergent denken noch convergent denken (vinden van 1 oplossing voor een probleem) [#NS15102011] {Sze} Meditation increases bodily awareness and hence intuition {which makes us either better or worse at rigged card games} [#NS09062012 Meditate to tap into subliminal messages] – meditation makes you more often aware of subliminal (short exposure) messages. [#McGon24] Meditation increases attention, focus, stress-management skills, impulse control and self-awareness. [#Davidson204] Meditators produce 5% more antibodies in response to a vaccine. [#210] Meditation makes response time more consistent, perhaps by reducing background chatter. It also increases the amplitude of gamma waves. Brain networks underlying vision and attention are much more active under meditation than when resting. Beyond 25,000 hours of practice (!) the activation of the attention network falls [takes longer time to automate?] Compassion meditation gives greater response in the insula in response to other people's suffering.[#Int051012] If people meditate for 30 minutes a day, there will be more gray matter in the hippocampus. [#NS110513] In any case seems to boost insulin levels and levels of telomerase, lowers chronic inflammation. [#MadeleinStrick] Meditatie zorgt voor sneller opmerken van patronen – is dit wat Rostan vond? [#NS020716MeditatorsTuneInToTheirUnconscious] People practicing mindfulness meditation are aware earlier of an impulse; people who have high hypnotizabulity later. [#Burkem65] Meditation also lowers sensitivity to pain, over and above distraction, and even if people are not meditating while the pain takes place. [#NS160516Ommm...Aargh!] Meditation, especially intensive sessions, sometimes leads to adverse effects, including panic and depression. Meditation in many cases also doesn’t help much. And, as Albert Ellis noted, in many cases it is better to attack the situations and dysfunctional thoughts that are at the core of your problems, instead of trying to tranquilize them. [#Lyubom243] Try presence of God meditation?[#Lyubom253] May help for course grades, IQ, against stress and depression. [#HaidtH36] Meditation reduces anxiety and increases contentment. [#NS14102017TrainYourBrainWithMeditation] Different types of meditation (mindfulness, compassion, thinking from different points of view) train different parts of the cortex.

Medium of expression: [#Weng75] Would you get different associations when writing, typing, talking or drawing about a subject? {EW: or sitting or standing?} To a tape recorder or a person?

Meetings: [#Loeh36] 15 minute non-business breaks after every 90 minutes in a meeting is very refreshing, and helps productivity. [#Ferr96] Try to avoid/prevent all meetings that do not have a clear objective. Never use meetings to define a problem, just decide what needs be done. And have an end-time for meetings. [#Schmid164] Attending meetings is not a badge of importance. Timekeeping matters + leave enough time at the end to summarize findings & action items, close early if possible. And don’t multitask at meetings (though that is challenging!)

Meitner, Lise: [#Crop330] Jewish descent, father lawyer with diverse interests, invited lots of interesting people, from writers to chess players to lawyers, into their home. Children liked/loved music. Decided to go to university, even though that was hard for girls, was taught/inspired by Bolzmann, and by studying together with the other student, Paul Ehrenfest. Bolzmann's suicide inspired her to stay in physics, to keep the spark alive. {? also for Darwin/Fermi?} Had to endure being ignored in Berlin by sexist German scientists, did find good collaborators, however (like Hahn), and made many friends in the physics community. Meitner tended to suffer from a guilty conscience {EW: some neuroticism? Or female upbringing?}. Had a sort of love affair with physics itself. Planck gave her her first paid academic work (even if it was grading papers). When she got an attractive offer from Prague, Planck notified Fischer who doubled her salary. When Nazis came to power, she doubted, and clung to Planck's and Hahn's advice to stay {fear of unknown more?}. However, she had many friends, including Debye, who tried to get her out. {problem was that she didn't have a valid passport anymore, and that academic positions were scarce} Must have followed discoveries in science closely, like the Joiliot-Curie finding of strange elements if uranium was bombarded with neutrons.With nephew Otto Frisch (fresh from Bohr's institute) she calculated the mechanism and energy of uranium splitting. Was opposed to making a bomb of it, though. Traveled too late to Copenhagen to discover neptunium (which she was sure was there).

Memes: [#Ster317] Memes may be protected by barriers to entry, or dispersed over different centers; both of which may hamper creativity as the creator cannot (easily) access those memes. [#Strien191] Memes are not always diffused independently; some may be in structures (scientific fields), others may ease or block one another's passing (if you like Jazz music) [#RikSpanjers/EW] memes can bounce all over the world; one artist having one or two major influences and many minor influeces, often creating a unique blend that can influence others. In science, Einstein made big memes, but current phycisists are also influenced by the ideas of many other 'smaller' scientists, and a few may make the big meme, noticeable contributions, which are however mostly more the 'big threads' of a bundle than the only ones linking past and future.

Memorability: [#59sec59] The easier something is to remember, the more accurate people rate it. Memorable, likable and repeatable, like in rhymes (Prudence and measure will bring you treasure) works best. Or just easy-to-prounounce company name.

Memory aids: [#Watt217] It may help to hang important diagrams in closets and such for automatic revision {EW: though revision may become very infrequent as they become habitual parts of the interior}. [#Tigg158] Memory aids (physical or social) can remind you to show a desired behaviour. Adding your name/positive emotion/goals helps, as can varying them if you find you ignore them. [#Gold167] When you make a commercial, putting the image of it on the product's packaging itself also helps, people need to see the aid when they are making the most relevant decision (for example, when in a bar or a store). For verbatim memorization of abstract words the Greeks tended to use a kind of 'standard library' of images compiled by Metodorus; current memorizers must rely on new libraries, often puns (“und” is a circle, 'rund'), or a memoria syllabarium (like I use for Japanese). Draschl associated a small set of words with emotions, not images; imagines what he is meaning, whether he is happy or sad. In the past, sometimes manuscripts were copied for no other reason than to help their copier memorize them. [#Foer177] Visualisation partly works since it enforces attention; and you can't dwell on something without making it more memorable. Some mnemonicists wear earmuffs and blinders to cut off distractions. You may not need to memorize the whole image, just one salient feature. In the end, just the trace of an emotion may be left. And know your images/characters better. What they look, feel, taste and sound like. How they walk, the cut of their clothes, their social attitude, their sexual preferences, their prospensity to gratuitous violence. Then let all of those characteristics impinge upon you at once. (and perhaps then let them walk through your house? Feel them in everyday situations?)

Memory inhibition: [#Wiki] Recalling one item from a list can inhibit the recall of related words {like the theoretical model showed, suppression of a common association makes the other item harder to recall}

Mendel, Georg: [#Strien249] Educated as a physicist! Sent his work to Darwin, but Darwin found it hard to read German and did not even open the magazine!

Mendeleev: [#Jaffe153] 'Every hair on his head seemed to be in disagreement with every other hair' Forebears were Russian, emigrated to Siberia (immigrants), grandfather first to print Siberian newspaper. Last child, father (rector of the gymnasium) died young. Mother was tartar. Learned basic of sciences from refugee who married his sister. Was favourite of mother, who brought him to Moskow, then St Petersburg, to learn sciences (for teaching) Loved the sciences, less much the classics. Worked hard, graduated at top of class, then mother died; his health deteriorated. Last message from mother was to work hard and find divine and scientific truth, to focus on work, not words. Almost died of TBC but was cured after Krim; could become 'privatdocent' in StPetersburg but quickly went to France and Germany, with Richault, Kirchhof and Bunsen. Married, wrote in 60 days a 500-page book on organic chemistry. Had been collecting all facts he could find and studying the elements for 20 years in 1869. Even dreamt about the systematizing of atoms! Made cards of all the elements, to sort them out. [EW: would this trick be useful for us, for rearranging facts?]. Was never afraid to challenge authority, like claiming that tellurium's weight should be wrong as it was in the wrong place. Was bold enough to make predictions [also never cut his hair]. Lothar Meyer constructed the same table almost simultaneously {so time was right}. Also was social reformer who hated the abuse of power in Russia; even though he had respect for the Czars; the Russian government usually sent him away to 'cool off'. M even offered to resign [he was proud and sensitive] when the government did not want to listen to his pleas. Handicapped his own Russian scientific prestige through his liberal ideas. Had great respect for Faraday. Saw women as having equal rights, and allowed them to follow his lessons and employed them. Could have tantrums, + married twice. Extremely thin skin, always wanted people to think well of him, but was basically very friendly. Worshipped Tolstoi. Loved books, especially adventure stories. Didn't like plays, but liked music and paintings. Also loved his mother, and was buried next to her.

Mental calculations: [#Howe132] Mental calculations differ from school-taught calculations as one needs to keep the information in memory to an absolute minimum.

Mental contrasting: [#Steel146] Visualize desired outcome, then visualize current situation; seems to optimize motivational pull of goals.

Mental energy: [#Parr135/EW] Mental energy is depleted by studying or by doing hard jobs which require thinking, creativity and independent work. 'Civil servant'-work is mentally not so exhausting, and can be combined more easily with one's study (Pauling being a sort of janitor, for example).

Mental engagement: According to #TaT[8], all humans learn through active mental engagement. They do however not consider the “conditioning” of 'capital of France is... Paris' etc. Meaningless facts can perhaps indeed best be learned by rote memorization, however do not expect much transfer. Active mental engagement is only useful if the knowledge somewhat links to the learner's experience and/or a teacher desires transfer.

Mental exercise: [#NS280505] Mental exercise can increase your strength 12 weeks of 15 minutes a day thinking about exercising biceps makes those 13% stronger. <EW: and I believe it even helps learn coordination in the absence of physical training>

Mental imagery: [#Simo29] Many creative geniuses use vivid or unusual imagery. (Einstein: imagination is more important than knowledge). Often words do not come into action in this process at all, until things need to be written down.

Mental maps: [#Stalla121/EW] We have mental maps of almost everything, though we are often not aware of their accuracy.

Mental model: [#EricB366] Experts have better mental models, and are more able to find an appropriate schema to fit incoming information.

Mental operations: [#Kluw80] Mental operations use approximately the same area as regular storage, only activate it more strongly {would this make active processing more useful for remembering things?} While storage seems to take place in the sensory processing modules, operations seem the general domain of the parietal cortex (that would therefore be the 'processor'),

Mental practice: [#EricB674] Also increases the M1 motor area in the cortex, just like physical practice does. [#More] It can help imagine the components mentally that are lacking from your actual practice situation. Can also help if all-physical practice would be too exhausting.

Mental rehearsal: [#Lieb102] Rehearsing desired behaviour mentally will make the change easier.

Mental toughness: [#Dwec96] The ability to maintain focus when everything seems to be against you. Especially useful in sports. [#EW/Csik2] Can (genetic?) mental toughness/determination (partly) compensate for lack of support, like with Perlman or Manfred Eigen?

Mental tricks: [#Marshmallow] Teaching kids to imagine the marshmallow is just a picture in an (imaginary) frame greatly helped them increase their self-control. But home environment/parents may be needed to turn tricks into habits.

Mentalizing: [#Nett159] Mentalizing is being able to attribute a mental state such as a belief or a desire to another person; contrast to empathizing, which is getting the emotion of the other person. Sociopaths have normal to high mentalizing skills but poor emphatizing skills; autism sufferers may have the reverse. Better mentalizing skills usually means that you have a wider circle of friends; is related to agreeableness (or can it be reverse in cause/effect; having more friends making you better? Can be mutual strengthening). [#EW] Agreeableness may correlate to the S dimension of Holland. [#NS240514TheBrightStuff] The size of key regions in your prefrontal cortex determines your mentalizing skills, which in turn determine the number of friends you have.

Mentors: [#Pau] Mentors are there to ask questions and give guidance; they may have more experience/knowledge than you in an area, in addition they are at a greater distance and can therefore be more objective. [#Howe103] Davy may have mainly been a model of what behaviour to avoid, but he had an infectuous enthousiasm about science and talked about it at length. [#McCo824] Find a mentor if possible! [#Eyse162] Mentors may partially explain why geniuses tend to cluster in 'golden ages' [#John159] Darwin had Lyell as 'mentor' by reading his books (and only later by personal contacts, but by then it was more between equals). Mentors help their pupils by their confidence in them. When having multiple mentors, people construct a kind of role model from their combined good features. [#Robi173] Charles Strafford was Ken Robinson's mentor (though perhaps mainly as the person who 'discovered' him and placed him in a more stimulating environment, so perhaps more as a facilitator). Public/Private Ventures found that coupling 1100 random children to volunteers improved their school prestations and got into trouble fewer times. [Robi] Mentors can recognize abilities/interests others do not see. [#EricB381] A 15-minute talk with a senior designer helps inexperienced designers tackle tasks both simple and complex.[#Pers156] Having a mentor is very helpful for your career, next to advice and experience mentors also give relisience (stick through hard times) and insight into one's own strengths and weaknesses. Though even just having a mentor seems to work quite well... [#Hatt188] Mentoring can have a positive effect on attitudes (d=0.6), but its effect on performance is minimal (around 0.18). [#Redirect145] Mentoring, as in the 'Big Brothers Big Sisters' programme, 3-5 hours a week with carefully screened mentors, helps disadvantaged kids perform better at school, have better relationship with parents, less likely to start using drugs and alcohol, less likely to hit others. Effect seems to grow over time. [#Foer261] Training with Europeans gave Foer an advantage over his competition in America, where mnemonics was less developed. [#Imagine246] Bob Dylan dissected great work, trying to figure out how it worked. [#hargit151] Abraham guided his student in reading appropriate literature (and Hargittai: either Nobel laureate or someone closely associated with a laureate). Tend to give freedom, but ruthlessly revise disciple's first writings. Also fair or even generous in assigning credits and letting pupils shine. James Watson and Walter Gilbert did not put their names on the papers of their students unless they had manually participated in the work. [#154] Some mentors work by a distance because a student studies their papers and their way of doing research. Sometimes that even works better; being to close to someone can prevent you from worshipping him or her. When James Watson was 23 years old, he went to a phase where he wanted to think how Linus Pauling thought, wanted to write papers in Pauling's style (thinks imitation is important). Sometimes two mentors complement each other: Aaron Klug had Rosalind Franklin as supervisor, who was detail-oriented and demanding, and Bernal, who was seldom there, but whose name brought famous visitors to the lab. Even visitor Buckminster fuller was inspiring: gave chaotic and enless lectures, but whereas most students turned away, Klug laboured hard to understand them. Even full professors can have mentors; Ahmed Zewail had Richard Bernstein, who was a first-rate experimentalist, had high integrity, worked all the time, had commitment to science and family, and was especially helpful to younger colleagues. Bernstein had attitude that life is short and that you shouldn't waste it with frivolous things, and that you should work all the time to reach the highest level. Also said that you would be remembered for only one thing, and that you should find that thing and forget the other things. Encounters never comfortable or relaxing. [#hargit159] Prof Harold Burn in Oxford called John Vane to his office one month after his arrival, telling him “Vane, I am not very happy. You must do better.” (later found out that Burn did that to all his students). Burn did teach him biological methods, though. Sometimes (John Cornforth / Robert Robinson) mentor and pupil start arguing from the first day, about structures, strategies, and other science topics. [#hargit159] Sometimes even a paper can become a mentor, like Avery's paper on DNA. Lederberg wanted to work with Ryan, even as a sophomore. Gave him no choice 'was a real pest'. Ryan had worked with (also great scientists) Beadle and Tatum, and recommended Lederberg moving there. Kuffler made almost more notes to the abtstract than the original text contained. [#Hargit161] Blobel had gentle mentor, Palade, who had remarks on manuscript like 'I would say this', 'I would not say that', 'Wonderful', 'Great' (Palade was not a co-author). Bruce Merrifield had two mentors: Max Dunn (who knew everything there is to know about amino acids) and Woolley (who needed to be read something only once to him, and remembered anything, and could relate information of many areas to a single idea). After telling Woolley his idea on an elevator ride, Woolley told him next day 'That may be a good idea. Why don't you work on it?' - that made all the difference. Some mentors, like Pitzer, leave their graduate students alone, but always make time for them, always willing to discuss the problem, offer advice, suggest a solution. Was also efficient; after you had reached the conlusion you would suddenly find yourself outside the doors of his office, with a warm feeling. Pimentel got close to his students socially. James Conant (while not the official supervisor) was interested in what one of the PhD-students in his lab was going to do, and then said that if he would do that, it'd be a footnote to a footnote in the history of chemistry. Actually told him thereby two things: that his project was not very important, and that he was supposed to do important things. [#Greene67] It's a sign of smartness to find great mentors and offer your services for free. [#Greene104] Over time you may start to increase your admiration for the mentor's achievement, or even model yourself like them. Mentors find this very flattering. Admiration also makes you more open to absorbing and imitating what they say and do. You may only want to go to mentors once you have acquired some basic skills and discipline so you are interesting to them. Of especial value: ability to organize; most Masters and people in power suffer from too many demands on their time and too much information to absorb. Try to see the world through their eyes and ask the simple question of what it is they need most. Best mentors are those with wide knowledge and experience, and not overly specialized in their field. It can also help to question them about their ways of doing things, mining all kinds of rich information. Having multiple mentors will also give you multiple allies and connections to draw upon later. Good mentors let you develop your own style and leave you when the time is right, becoming life-long friends and allies. Note that your own mentor also moved on from his or her mentor... [#Greene112] Your choice of mentor may be based on what you need – an ideosyncratic one or a domineering one if (like Jung) you are unsure about what you want [EW....] [#Greene120] Most fighters turned out to their mentor way too soon, thought they 'knew it all' after a while and stopped learning. [#Catmul122] Sometimes mentoring is very informal, like in the early days of Pixar people working closely together with John. But directors which did not have that informal mentoring experience.

Mere exposure effect: [#Switch254] The more you are exposed to something, the more you like it. [#EW020813] Would internet dates have a lower chance of success relative to summer camp/employees/classmates dating due to this? Or due to having a better sample of behaviour? Or because of shared experiences?

Merit: [#Feist22] Science (at least physics) is largely meritocratic, quality of work as judged by colleagues most important predictor of success. It's just when two people are of about equal merit that extra's like mentors, institutions, pedigree and training have their greatest impact.

Meta-ideas: [#Imagine223] Ideas that help create other ideas, like cities, books, internet, institutions that make cities liveable, willingness to take risks, etc.

Meta-knowledge: [#EricB96] Knowing whether you have enough data to warrant a conclusion or to attempt solving it.

Metacognition: [#Clar314] Metacognition is the ability to set (learning) goals and adjust the strategies if the goals are not reached. 1) Setting relevant and realistic goals, 2) determine how best to achieve a goal 3) monitoring progress towards the goal 4) adjusting when needed. Lower self-regulatory skills cause attrition in programmes with less supervision. Unfortunately, most learners do not know what they know or not know, are not aware of which study methods are most effective, estimate their performance poorly, or overestimate their ability to do a test (especially the poor performers!). Self-regulation can be assessed with tests such as START and LASSI [#Clar321] You can also train self-regulation in class! [#Clar330] Can be trained by showing video of expert at work versus novices at work, with voice-over about the strategies they are using (is this approach working?). Works if people actively respond to video, ask questions like graphing or recording the strategies used by the expert, and how they will apply the expert strategies to their own problems. This must be followed by practice and feedback “what are you doing now? Why are you using that approach? What other approaches have you considered?” [#Marshmallow] 4-year olds are just figuring out metacognition; thinking about thinking, and how to effectively resist temptation (some erroneously assumed that staring at the marshmallow would help).[#Stol88] The more unfamiliar a problem or learning, the more important metacognitive skills are. The skills are planning, selecting, connecting, tuning and monitoring. [#Bron172] Cognitive control uses two brain regions: one that pays attention to whether thre right result is reached, and one allocates more cognitive resources based on the findings of the first system.[#Bregman1] Know what the purpose of the course is, and know what will determine your grade, so you can apply your efforts efficiently. [#Will137] Since metacognition and self-talk demand working memory, novices are less likely to do it, and they do so less efficiently than experts [but Zimmerman's research? Self-talk when not simultaneously trying to solve the problem may help] [#NS180513] Asking people how confident they are that they chose the right answer can help test for metacognition; good 'metacognizers' seem to have more grey matter in the anterior prefrontal cortex. But could it also be trained by such tests? Application for children: 7-11 year olds know pretty well how good they are at a subject, but don't apply it by switching to other subjects if they know something already quite well.

Metacognitive skills: [#Hatt30] Metacognitive skills are more important than intellectual ability if a learning task is very complex for the student. [#Hatt189] Can have good effect (d=0.69), especially with remedial students, in higher grades, small-group instruction and in less intensive programs. More varied instructional strategies during lesson help the learning. Ideally, teaching metacognitive skills needs to be interwoven in the subject itself.

Metacognitive strategies: [#EricB57] Metacognitive strategies, such as monitoring when problem-solving goes well or the situation is unknown/strange, are explicitly learnable. Metacognitive knowledge is essentially a type of knowledge.

Metalimbic system: [#Kluw59] Works with the neutotransmitter dopamine as well as endogenous opiates, involved in the formation of positive memory, pleasure and rewards. {role dopamine versus role opiates?} Note though that stimulation is only pleasurable if the organism has bodily or psychic needs. Also site for effects of alcohol and psychotropic drugs; dopamine is only involved in learning the addiction. Is more predictor for reward than reward substance itself (opiates seem to do that) {EW: … ponder!}

Metaphores: [#Ster104] Often creators use metaphors for their work (Darwin's tree of life), and both add metaphors to aspects where other metaphors (models?) are more appropriate (Darwin used four or five families of metaphors), or replace old metaphors with better ones. [#HaidtH181] With the wrong metaphor we are deluded; with no metaphor we are blind.

Metaprograms: In NLP, metaprograms are programs or “global settings” that permeate all or almost all of a person’s personality. Examples are people-directed versus self-directed, need-driven versus want-driven. While it would be foolish to think that anyone is exclusively directed in one direction, in general people have tendencies to be near the one or the other end of the spectrum. Misunderstandings mostly arise when people with vastly different metaprograms try to communicate.

Metcalf's law: [#Susski158] The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users connected to it.

Methods: [#Gall61] Most 'taught' methods for doing something are not absolute, they may change over time, and different methods to accomplish the same result have specific advantages and disadvantages, so it can be helpful to master several versions and use where appropriate. [#DanielAgmon] Students in area studies are not really taught methods (=how to approach research). Either 'taught' by giving articles on methodology that are not discussed sufficiently, or just by inundating students with a huge number of papers. Also, of course, which methodology to pick for a certain situation [remember Sommerfeld!]

Mezzofanti: [#Erard5] Spoke many languages (40-50), but 'never said anything': was conservative, not really great in producing original ideas. Even he needed flashcards and translated texts to keep his memory up, though he had a great ear for pronunciations. Actively enhanced his languages by seeking contact with all strangers coming to Bologna, by letting the hotel keepers apprise him of their arrival. Seemed neurotic, and only slept 3 hours a night. Got kind of nervous breakdown from trying to read Chinese. Pronounciation was too perfect for a native.

Michelangelo: [#Weiner104] Michelangelo did not care about money. [#122] Was enough fervent in pursuit of his art (and insensitive to mores) that he asked a certain priest for cadavers so he could conduct anatomical studies.

Michelin model: [#Robi242] You can better compare schools according to the Michelin model (stars for restaurants, by experts), than with the standardized model of fastfood restaurants (standardized tests).

Microbiome: [#NS310312] Healthy individuals have gthe most diverse collections of bacteria in their gut; variations in the microbiome have been linked to Chron's disease, asthma, Parkinson's and autism, and obesity may also be caused by antibiotics killing off gut bacteria. [#NS210712] Elderly people going into nursing homes change diet within weeks, but their gut bacteria take up to a year to change, and at that time their health shows its sharpest decline. [#NS270713] Microbiomes may poison hybrid wasps.

Micromanaging: [#Stalla13] Micromanaging/overcontrolling tells us: “we are incompetent, not to be trusted or respected”

Microteaching: [#Hatt112] Teachers giving small lessons, being taped, and the results being discussed. Works quite well (d=0.70), in any case much better than ' conventional' teacher education (d=0.15)

Middle class: [#Zuck?] Most geniuses had parents from the middle class {not lower, nor upper!} [#AdjiedjBakasNRC250114] The German middle class has shrunk with 5 million people over the last 10 years. Entrepreneurs and talented highly educated personnel, and unschooled personel for non-automated labor (cleaning etc.) may have a good future, though.

Midlife crisis: [#NS280913_OliverRobinson] There is a 40-50% chance per decade to have some kind of crisis, men in their 40s can have a bit of it, especially if they do feel a crisis then, they don't see positive consequences. Note that many young adults tned to think that adulthood will be a fairly easy ride, like living in a glossy magazine. So when the heard times hit, they are not prepared for it.

Migration: [#59sec125] Groups whose members exchanged to create totally new groups produced more ideas (and more creative ones) than groups whose memberships remained constant, despite the 'constant groupies' rating their groups more friendly and productive!

Mill (John Stuart): Father had been outstanding student and tutor{!}. May have shown a bit of psychoticism, as he refused to believe in the church, for which he was educated to be a preacher. Mill Senior had remarkable energy and stubbornness (he never neglected to vent opinions, despite those being very unpopular) and never “cut corners”, wanting the job done properly {labor ethic?}. Father was a very demanding teacher, always asking more than John Stuart could do. During his morning walks gave accounts to his father of what he had read. Mostly interested in history {influence of father, who wrote one?}. Also had to rephrase what father had told him in his own words. Father loved to show his son books on energetic and resourceful men in unusual circumstances. At eight had to teach his siblings, which was good because it forced him to learn more carefully, and bad because teaching your brothers and sisters is an awkward familial relationship (responsibility without authority) besides, his father held JS accountable if his siblings failed his tests). Maths teaching became more difficult, since his father could not teach him at a certain point but demanded he learn and understand everything from books, and punished JS if he failed difficult problems because JS didn't have the necessary knowledge! JS started writing his own histories (compilations of Roman histories) as a hobby. His father encouraged him, but never asked to see what he wrote, which was probably wise {critical eye} His father though always explained his reasons for wanting JS to do this or that. Generally left his son the choice of the subjects of his poem writing. Loved reading about experimental science. Father always emphasized understanding things and being able to also understand their use. Found dissecting bad arguments very useful practice, as was studying Socrates' dialogues. Sometimes he didn't understand what his father explained to him, but he mulled on it and it became a sort of crystallisation core. Father did have an irascible temper. Often TOLD how something should be read, whereas his father better might have SHOWED it himself. Father trusted too much in the abstract without support of the concrete. Political economy was taught by the father lecturing to his son during walks, and the son showing him a written account of it the next day, which was corrected until it was clear, precise, and fairly complete. Father charged JS to find the fallacies in Adam Smith's arguments {EW: again a way to train thinking, just like detecting fallacies} Giving explanations only afterwards, not before, JS had to find out everything for himself. Was never told anything that could be found out by thinking, until he had really exhausted all efforts. Asking more of the students than they can do can be good {EW: at least when they are somewhat advanced in an area, would be discouraging for beginners}, but anger on the teacher's part does not help. Father stressed hard work and the ability to endure pain and work. JS fears education that only teaches what children like cannot be complete, and that fear of punishment must be a part, even though it should be diminished as much as possible. {though good teachers may create good gaps} Also stayed for a year in France, during which he learned that English behaviour was not always best, and learned about continental liberalism. Reading Bentham's book on morals was a revelation to him, made him, in his own words, “a different person.” Read lots of books (mainly on psychology and religion and such) and began to write his own essays. Also met many illustrous men with whom he could discuss his favourite subjects. Established the Utilitarian Society (a very small club for discussions on Utilitarism). Father believed in self-efficacy, that individuals could do good though judicous effort. Father believed in unlimited possibility for improvement of intellectual and moral character by education. JS had lots of ambition, and a sort of (abstract) love for mankind. {like Einstein? Probably being both moral and intelligent/perceptive can make one very critical of specific others, even though one can love (the potential of?) humanity in general} JS claims to have benefited much from editing Bentham's work {EW: because he was forced to look critically at the quality of sentences?}

Millionaires: [#Burkeman164] They typical millionaire is disciplined and driven, street-smart but not necessarily intellectual, and frugal. [May also need stubbornness, lack of regard of what other people think of you, and a willingness to take risks

Mind: [#Whit23] The mind may be the most important part in sports performance. [#Arno25] The mind doesn't tire from exertion, just from lack of change. [#Laird/EW] Is brain the computer, and the mind the software? I think it is integrated; the 'software' being in the connections between the brain cells, but each brain cell, like a tiny organism, being for a part self-startinga and taking its own initiative, in contrast to the orderly start-up procedure of computers.

Mind wandering: [#NS200517DaydreamBeliever] People can also let their mind wander intentionally (instead of just unintentionally), like wandering on a topic. Deliberate mind wandering can be practiced, also with mindfulness meditation. Note that thoughts about the past tend to lead to lower mood and motivation; those about the future to higher mood and motivation

Mindfullness meditation: [#Pers314] tends to produce positive changes in both the brain and the immune system. [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hhGcusoGYc&feature=autoplay&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&playnext=1] Mindfullnes, being aware of an emotion, may help fight its impact [fear, like in 'the Game', for example] 'Surfing the urge' Where do you feel it in your body? What are your thoughts? 'surf the urge', be on top of the wave, don't try to suppress it, but wait till it subsides; you don't have to act on it [instead: remember your goal and which action can help you achieve it]. [#McGon225] Observe your feelings, but remind yourself that you don't have to act on those thoughts and feelings. [#Davidson174] Depressed patients can be treated (helped?) by teaching them that depressive thoughts are just electrical activity in the brain.

Mindmap: [#Jurre] Mindmaps can be useful to create new ideas, or to create an overview of ideas. [#Robi101] Mindmaps can also be of use to make an overview of ideas more vivid or inspiring, to see connections between things.

Mindset: [#Dwec13] You can have a fixed mindset for one area (personality) and a growth mindset for another area (like intelligence). {EW: seems a bit phlogiston-like: if some people with a fixed mindset also believe in effort – how predictable is the fixed mindset of behaviour? - probably is confusing mindset with where one gets his or her sense of validation from}[#EW] A mindset is essentially a worldview, a belief or set of beliefs you have about the world and reality. Children tend to absorb mindsets from authority figures in their environment (parents/teachers), they do not learn to critically evaluate and construct their own mindsets (hence the college-dropout mom may have infected her son with her mindset, even if she did not mean to). Could children learn to construct their own mindsets? With certain mindsets, you'll be less dependent on extrinsic rewards to keep going, as every reward is filtered through ones mindset. However, experience can in the end 'break through' any mindset, as people can adjust their worldview on their experience (like they should!), though they may be more or less resitance in some respects. [#CIA] Mindsets are resistant to change; also, new information is incorporated into the mindset, making people blind to gradual changes. The more confident someone is of the validity of his image, the more ambiguous the information is, the more difficult it is to adjust ones mindset. [#Greene17] (Nietzsche) “Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. They acquired greatness, became “geniuses” (as we put it), through qualities the lack of which no one who knew what they were would boast of: they all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole. “

Mining: ask someone how they would think about X.

Mirages: [#Catmul201] Do certain efforts improve the film in any real way? Used popsicle sticks to show that effort spent on A is taken away from B.

Mirroring: mirroring a child's body language builds trust and helps the child learn (even if a robot does it).

Misfortune: [#Burn413] Misfortune and difficult people may look horrible, but in reality present great opportunities for personal growth and increasing your skills.

Misinformation effect: [#NS090213] Having a robot interrogate suspects decreases the chance that there are false memories generated/offered. At least: misinformation provided by the robot does not have any effect [EW: do people not learn so well from robots? Or do they miss the emotional emphasis?

Misleading: [#CIAch4] When using an analogy, comparison or model, always ask yourself in which ways the model may be misleading.

Mismatch: [#Nass128] Mismatch between content and emotion (or between aspects of a person) results in more cognitive work and less liking [EW: but better memory?]. Negativity and excitement parts of the brain. You should not therefore try to match signals, by giving critcism with a smile or good news in a calm voice.

Mistakes: [#Ferr226] There are two kinds of mistakes: mistakes of ambition (doing something without complete information) and mistakes of sloth (not to do something because of lack of courage) [#Gold99] People learn more from the mistakes of others than from stories that focus on people who did the right actions. [EW: because errors trigger stronger emotions?/innate risk aversion of adults?] [#Strien243] Watson and Crick could place 'om de beurt' a new piece of the puzzle, but often only if they had removed some of the previous pieces laid. [#CoyleT14] It is allowed to make mistakes as a side-effect of pushing your boundaries. [#Weiner116] Geniuses make more mistakes than the rest of us. [#Schmid15] Mistakes are cheaper now (prototyping, 3D printing). Fail fast, fail cheap etc.

Mitnick, Kevin: [#NS130811] 'Ghost in the Wires' A loner as a child, Mitnick's primary entertainment was in trying to understand how the world worked.

Mixed practice: [#EricB345] Mixed practice, where examples of confuseable categories are interspersed, is more efficient than practice blocked in categories.

MKP-1: [#NS231010] Protein that inhibits a pathway of neural growth and development; is highly expressed in depressed people, and heighening its expression in mice produces depressed mice. Antidepressants reverse that effect.

Mnemonics: [#Watt185] Even Watts already knew some mnemonic system, based on the words in a known rhyme, or the latin names of animals. {EW: we use a 'hatstand' method, or number->word system}[#Stol103] Sixth of six cognitive strategies for remembering. Famous techniques are acronyms (SMASHIN’SCOPE), Acrostics (Friese Apen Eten Alle Dagen Gort/ Geef De Aap een Bakje Fruit), rhymes (Do is deer, a. ..) Key words (important words in phrases) [#Hatt191] Learning mnemonics helps special need students. But apparently also students in general. [#NS280505MemoryMarvels] Mnemonics champions use three brain areas in memorizing that normal people do not; most notably brain areas involved in navigation and movement. Actors, in contrast, link words with emotions and movements. Anyone who pairs words with previously learned actions remembers 38%, versus 14%

Mobile experiment: [#Root03] Teachers knew what was required to make a functional mobile (equal mass*distance ratios) but where not able to build functional mobiles. Their students, however could (even though they could not explain how they did it)

Mobility: [#Hatt82] Every change in school is disruptive to student's achievement; effect is only lessened if the child makes new friends in the school fast (within one month)

Mobilization effect: [#RoosVonkInt240212] The more societal unrest about a political decision, the more politicians 'dig in' to avoid losing face.

Modality principle: [#Clar106] Describe visuals with audio rather than on-screen text. Note that it does not apply so much for second-language learners who can better read text at their own speed, or for instructions which need to stay visible (like practice instructions).

Model building: [#Howe65] Both George Stephenson and Isaac Newton were enthusiastic model builders in their youth.

Modeling: [#Root03] Tenth of 13 thinking tools, modeling involves making a model of a process or object. Modeling requires combination of some of the simpler thinking tools. [#McCo824] Modeling can also mean imitating the work of experts in your field, learning from them. {EW} Are models used to overcome the limits of working memory in holding too many chunks of information? [#RoadToExcel36] Modeling is a great way of learning/improving yourself when feedback is slow or absent. [so known cases and outcomes, think chess players and Franklin]

Models: [#Colv44] Experts in horse-betting have much more complex (and multiplicative) models than novices. [#Hatt246] People have preconceptions/models about the world before entering class, those must be corrected/filled with facts to build newer and more complete models, and finally one needs metacognition to keep track of where the learning is going and whether it is going into the right direction. [#Laird9] Can we view the mind as something that creates models of reality, to act on them? {EW: so may be crude models, like language} [#NS15102011] Embodiment (your internal model of your body) results from the need from the brain to integrate information from multiple senses.

Modesty: [#Nass52] Criticizing yourself makes others like you more but also consider you less competent than blaming others. Though blaming the customer makes people refuse to buy books! Praising yourself makes people dislike you even more, but makes them feel you are more competent.

Modi and Pauling combo: [#EW03102011] Get ideas on different times, in different environments, may help their variety.

Modified contiguity theory: [#Kluw8] The change in associative strength of a CS is proportional to the difference between reality and expectancy.

Momentum: [#Schafer52] Momentum is more inmportant than results, especially in the beginning, keep the momentum going!

Money: [#Pers3] With few exceptions it's not money that people want, they want luxury and love and admiration. [<Steinbeck>] [#Whit10] Money motivates only if it is perceived as a measure of self-worth, or when more important things like job security and quality of life at the workplace are absent. [#ChristianeKneer; http://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/Working%20Paper%20392_tcm47-296166.pdf] If banks are deregulated and wealthy, the growth of the high-tech sector of the economy suffers. [#Weiner104] Rutherford: “We have no money so we will have to think.”

Monitoring: [#Bloo529] Parents of talented children carefully monitored the children's progress, and intervened/sought help or replacement teacher when things were going poorly.[#Stol90] The fifth metacognitive skill, monitoring is like “interactive planning” - seeing if things go wrong or do not work as expected, and adjust accordingly.

Monozygotic twins: [#Simo127] Can be too similar on some characteristics, probably these are coded for by several genes, which unique combination would occur more often in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. This is also called emergenesis.

MOOCs: Udacity, Khan Academy, Coursera, Sebastian Thrun, EdX; usually very expensive to create, since all material used needs to be original, and lots of students (>90%) don't finish the course. (98%: Vivek Goel, opening academic year Leiden 2014). Also as test of text book?

Mood: [#Ster304] A better mood may make people (in any case children) more creative. {the happy songwriter}[#Stol37] The third factor in motivation, people learn better when they are in a better mood, though there may be some optimum, as euphoric people don't learn so well (perhaps concentration problems?) <EW: what does mood do?> In general mood can be thought of as the overall assessment of the environment – if it can yield large rewards easily, or only small ones with much difficulty. Based on that assessment, energy expenditure is allotted, much like lending money when the investment would yield dividends. A good mood not only energizes you, but is also attractive to other people, as it gives the impression that you are a successful person. [#Burn12] Our moods are formed by our cognitions (=thoughts). [#Zill259] One's mood can be modulated by choosing the appropriate entertainment, comedy or something unexciting if you are stressed, something exciting if you're bored, and so on... [#Flourish80] Positive mood: broader attention, more creative thinking, more holistic thinking; negative mood: narrowed attention, more critical thinking, more analytic thinking; but also results in more defensiveness and following orders well. [#227] Mood increases with tolerance in a nation.[#Sommers52] People are more helpful when they're standing in front of a bakery, since their mood increases due to the sweet smells. [#SciAmMindNovDec11] Even unconscious exposure to cues (like Fast food logo's) can influence our moods (in that case, make us more impatient and less thrifty). So mystery mood swings can occur from subconscious exposure, even if we have goals we are not consciously aware of. Knowing the reason of the mood swing helps. [EW: and a false reason?] [#NS310115]  Interestingly, the adaptive immune cells (B cells?) from mouse that were bullied (stressed/depressed) had mood-enhancing effects (more exploration, more interest in females) when injected into other mice. So adaptive cells may give a mood boost, especially when stressed, but that effect seems to be counteracted by other systems, at least in depressed animals. However, cells from the innate immune system do cause depression in other mice. [#Seligm20] Doing a kindness for others (especially an unexpected one) helps one's mood. [#Seligm30] A Gratitude visit definitely helps (write a letter 300 words max to someone you are grateful to, and ask to visit them). [#Seligm33] What went well exercise also works: 3 things that went well today, and why it happened (why did it happen). +why did this happen/what does this mean to you + how can you have more of this good thing in the future?

Moral internalisation: [#Redirect86] If you spank children, they'll learn not that what they did was wrong, but that it's unwise to do it when you're around. [besides, it teaches children that physical violence is an acceptable way to influence other's behaviour, and kids are good imitators]. Mild threats are better than strong threats: then children will internalize the behaviour, but since they don't think it was because of the situation (the threat) they decide they themselves wanted it. {EW: similar to motivators for action} Experiments needed to find the level of reward that is mild enough to be internalized, but effective enough to act upon.

Moral licensing: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201101/autopsy-the-abandoned-new-years-resolution] If we do something virtuous (or even imagine doing it) we tend to splurge afterwards. Works via moralizing “if I do this I am a good person” - if you look at behaviour as an instrument for achieving your goals, moral licensing is much less effective. Related to goal liberation: checking off one goal frees working memory for the next-most non-satisfied goal, such as splurging. Better to see your actions as evidence that you are committed to your goal, or think why you have resisted. [#McGon83] We want to feel 'good enough' (no need to overdo it). Feeling good about yourself means that you are more likely to trust your impulses. Anything you moralize becomes fair game for the effect of moral licensing (“I am good because I went to fitness yesterday”). So not really a willpower failure – morally licensing people actually feel god about themselves, ' giving themselves a treat'. Moral licensing also works for considering virtuous actions (like imagining yourself teaching in a homeless shelter) or even for bad actions you didn't do (I didn't eat the whole pizza!) [#103] Effect is most likely when being punished for bad behavior (fine for picking up children late from daycare, paying extra to plant trees). But paying to replace (not compensate) a harmful act to something good can work (pay 10% more for green energy). Perhaps through strengthening commitment/identity. Perhaps that is the crux of moral licensing: change your identity into someone who really wants the good. Would moral licensing be an identity crisis, that we think we are the bad person?

Morality: [#Witt49] You need to raise smart children to be moral too and not be too impatient or violent or look down on their fellow-men. [#Nett124] For immorality you need to take away three roadblocks: fear of repercussions (low N), lack of empathy (low A), and lack of deliberation (low C). It is rare that all three are missing. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2013/sociale-gelijkheid-als-moreel-ideaal.html?utm_source=130507-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=sociale-gelijkheid-als-moreel-ideaal&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief ] Morality is considered as more positive if presented as a 'moral ideal' than if it is presented like a 'moral duty'. [#NS260915] The closer we are to an action (pushing a person versus flicking a switch) the stronger our moral feelings, and the less our calculating brain kicks in. We also judge actions (giving a poison pill, shooting) on how they make us feel; but we can relearn that as we learn moral behaviour through dopamine system and basal ganglia; so seek out experiences (looking at meat factory). Or what should WE do? [moral mass, being part of group/identity]

Moralizing: [#McGon87] Labeling behavior as 'good' or 'bad' incites our reactance. Much better to consider something as morally neutral, just something that helps you reach your goals.

Moravec, John: Educational futurologist.

Morphing: [#Nass87] Morphing your face with that of teleconferencee on screen would use similarity attraction to make conference proceed more smoothly.

Mortality: [#TheWormAtTheCore-book review] When reminders of our mortality do penetrate, we protect ourselves by fiercely guarding our world views.

Moseley: [#Crop320] Mosely was an undistinguished student hired by Rutherford, wanted to study X-rays, Rutherford was doubtful since noone in Manchester had experience with them, so Mosely went to train with the authority on X-rays, Bragg, first. Was extremely hard worker, working to exhaustion. [#Jaffe220] Volunteered to be sent to the front, even if he was allowed to work in the war labs {so very idealistic?} Very interested in plants, animals (like his father) and archaeology. Very conscientous (work was always number one), and no detail escaped his attention, even not as a soldier. Father died when Harry was four, profesor of comparative anatomy at Oxford university, very hard worker, but died due to overwork(?). Henry also loved maths, scholarship for sciences to go to Oxford, but also excelled in the Classics. Lots of family members who also were scientists. Graduated cum laude, and visited Rutherford before graduating. Gave up lectorship at the university to spend all his time on experiments. Actually worked on quite some different subjects, from the number of electrons that radium emitted, to the upper limit of charge that a piece of radium could get, to the half life of actinium. Could work 15-hour days. Also extremely patient, when yet another membrane had burst

Most interesting: [#Drive2] Monkeys may learn to solve puzzles even without rewards or biological 'drives' like hunger or lust for sex {EW: but only if there's nothing else to do? And possibly that intermediate steps are visible?}

Motherese: [#Zill140] Young children pay more attention to motherese (slower cadence, higher pitch, exaggerated intonation).

Motivation by association: [#Syed110] Term for being motivated for something because someone similar to you is being successful in it.

Motivational interviewing: [#SellHuman146] “On a scale of 1 to 10, how motivated are you to...” ? then: “Why didn't you pick a lower number.” (Instant Influence, Michael Pantalon)

Motor learning: [NS110415-Baudish] – you can stimulate the muscles of someone to make them do something automatically (like where to walk, for example, or how to perform a skill)

Motor levels: [#EricB480] Focusing attention on ones action has variable results (performance increasing/decreasing for novices/experts). It may be that explicit attention interferes on a level that is appropriate for novices (who do not have very high-level motor skills yet) but not for experts?

Movement: [#Edu] Using movement you can learn things better (such as remembering a story you act out [EW: interference/interaction with people becoming more alert?]) Remembering things when you take the same physical posture is also easier. [#volkskrant – Tolstoi as teacher let shy or stubborn children 'huppelen' in class] [#IntBramVanDenBergh] If you bend your arm, you choose three times as often for an immediate reward.

Movies: [#Redirect179] Seeing people smoke in movies makes children more likely to conclude smoking is cool. However, this can be prevented by showing anti-smoking advertisment in the beginning.

Mozart effect: [#NS/EW] Listening to Mozart's music slighly boosts children's test scores – but so does listening to their favourite songs or a story by Stephen King beforehand! Apparently, being in a better mood enhances cognitive prestation. At the moment, it seems unclear what exactly causes this. Theoretically, highter arousal only improves performance on simple tasks since it narrows one's focus and prevents meandering minds. Perhaps that's the 'secret' here, for most tests you don't need too much creative thinking, just focusing on the task at hand, even though it is boring. {EW: Reynier would listen to music perhaps for this reason, it distracted me however since I needed to shut it out during thinking, which cost me extra energy}

Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus: [#Greene170 Was exceptionally emotional and sensitive from his earliest years, wild mood swings, perpetually anxious, except when playing the piano, where he could lose himself in music. Felt that he would die young after having a string fever at age 10. Mingled with the most celebrated composers of his time on his tour through Italy. Hated being confined to Salzburg, not mingling with composers or listening to famous orchestras; isolated from the European centers of music, and a town with no theater or opera tradition. When composer to the bishop, had to write very conventional music; started to lose his love for music. [#Weiner225] Mozart gambled a lot; earned well, but lost more, so was always in financial trouble. Was very motivated by money, almost exclusively worked if he got paid for it (but could get into a kind of trance or flow when composing) [EW: perhaps the money was needed to get him to overcome resistance and start working? But after that hurdle had passed…] Also, when young, copied works of the masters (like Haydn) by hand.

MPC: [#Nelissen178] Medioventral Prefrontal Cortext; calms down amygdala (fear/anger). Left part for positive emotions, right part for negative emotions. Positive effects of anger (extra energy) in left side, negative effects (aggression) on right side.

Mr Burns: Mr. Burns (Simpsons) does not give a damn about what other people think, which makes him sympathetic or even “cool” to some degree.

MRF: [#Kluw198] Reticular formation, involved in attention. Stimulating it brings brain waves from alfa to beta or even gamma, high arousal (but probably lower creativity). {EW: would this also be why geniuses seem so energetic?}

Mulling: [#Crop18] Newton claimed to have found the theory of gravitation by thinking on it continually.

Mullis, Kary: [#C2W050604] Nobel prize winner, inventor PCR. Created a rocket when a youngster to shoot a frog to 1.5 km. Tried to earn money as a writer after his PhD. Reads a lot (up to 8 hours a day). Was always curious and creative, but reads 'the annual reviews of immunology” not because they are 'good reading' but because he wants to find out how it works, as one needs an arsenal of 'toys' to solve a problem.

Multimedia: [#Medi210] The main rules of multimedia are: 1] that students learn better from words and pictures than from words alone. 2) Temporal contiguity principle: words and pictures are given simultaneously instead of successively. 3) Spatial contiguity principle: words and pictures near each other on screen. 4) coherence principle: extraneous information excluded, 5) modality principle: animation+narration>animation+on-screen text [#Clar306] A problem presented in multimedia can stimulate discussion more than when just text is used. {EW: vividity?} [#henkFrencken090115] Videos can be much more efficient to show experimental methods than mere words (unless the audience is very familiarwith the techniques used; or the techniques are irrelevant, in which case you don't need to spend time on them). Also: nice idea to make a science talent video on my one for youtube. [live drawing is also a popular style]

Multimodal brain regions: [#Kluw44] There are brain regions that process and combine the information of different senses. Since brain reorganisation can work in both directions, it could for example help in recruiting the visual area in blind people for auditory tasks. Note however that if regions are not stimulated enough, they tend to atrophy somewhat or grow thinner, which always remains a risk if people lose their sight or hearing.

Multiplicative model: [#Simo152] The theorem that for creativity many factors play a role, and that creativity is a kind of multiplication of Guassian curves, which has longer tails than a normal distribution.

Multiplier effect: [#Colv199] Another name for the Matthew effect.

Multitasking: [#Medi87] People cannot multitask; interrupted people work 50% slower and make 50% more errors {one of the reasons why talking on a cellphone is dangerous when driving}. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201006/week-in-willpower] Actually, people who often multitask are worse at it than people who seldom multitask! [does it erode your ability? Or is it preselection?] [#Nassxii] Frequent multitaskers pay less attention to emotional signal in faces and posture, and will more often ask speakers to repeat themselves. [#NS070913] Brain training may help with general multitasking skills if a specific multi-tasking skill is trained; perhaps the generic brain training programmes try train too many skills at once? [http://www.intermediair.nl/carriere/doorgroeien/competenties/Multitasken-maakt-meer-kapot-dan-je-lief-is?utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=wk28&utm_campaign=traffic]

Murad, Ferid: [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368_supp/full/478S10a.html] Mother was American, who eloped with Albanian immigrant {EW: so two cultures at home, especially since father-culture can be strong like surrounding culture} I'm a workaholic. I love science. I think about it almost all the time. Even when I try to relax: watching TV or doing something else, I can only do that for 5 to15 minutes, then I get distracted thinking about experiments. It has been disruptive to family life. I have five children and I probably haven't spent enough time with them over the years. When they were younger, I would always take 2 to 3 weeks in the summer to go camping with them, and I tried to be home every day for dinner. But even if I made it, I often went to my study or back to the lab afterwards. I was fortunate because I had a long period of training and had many mentors who were excellent. They tended to give me a lot of freedom; they were there to help me and answer problems and review ideas. I try to recognize the strengths of each of them and come up with some hybrid that I can be as a mentor, to use the best features of each. My first mentor in graduate school, Earl Sutherland Jr — who received a Nobel prize in 1971, taught me a lot about creativity. Research is not doing what's been done before — that's confirmation. Research is doing something that's never been done before — that's creativity.

MUSE: [#NS300515] App with EEG headset that trains people to focus their attention.

Music: [#Scho161] Music distracts from work, which effect is more serious as the work demands more mental attention. Music is only good if you else don't have the energy to work, or when the work is mainly physical and boring. [#NS280505] The ' Mozart effect' seems just due to improving your mood, though music lessons seem to improve the IQ with 2 to 3 points relative to drama lessons <Ewmore visual skills? What kind of IQ?>, though this may just be a result of being a very “schooly” kind of lesson in contrast to drama lessons [#Edu] [EW: may be that children must pay closer attention, that musical training is a kind of attention training as well]. [#Zill176] Music is generally arousing, puts people in a positive mood, and/or reduces anxiety. Note that most young listeners don't understand (or do not hear well, or in any case do not know) the exact lyrics of popular songs. [#Hatt144] Music is a very effective reward for establishing desired behaviour. [#NRC140411] Old people who have practiced music for a long time have better memory and cognitive skills than older people who have less musical experience. [#EW150712] Would music pep you up and thereby help combat listlessness and depression [but perhaps should start out slow for mood-matching first?] [#http://www.intermediair.nl/artikel/werketiquette/376205/muziek-terwijl-je-werkt-kan-schadelijk-zijn.html?&utm_campaign=redactiemailing&utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Week382012] Can be helpful to optimize arousal level, but can distract from job itself. [#NRC290510] Preference for terts, quart, quint and sext increases the longer people had music lessons; such preference for harmonies seems learned. Next to that, simple ratios in ground tone and overtones of two different tones help. [#Int210912] Music can be used to sooth anxious patients, to give energy, but also to keep other noises out. It does distract thinking, though. [#Hargit109] Music-loving scientists: {Max Planck} Manfred Eigen, Georg Wittig [#NRC] Look for research Mark Mieras, jeugdcultuurfonds, Says that music increases reading skill, emotional intelligence, listening skill and language processing, may also aid in treatment of dyslexia. [#http://www.intermediair.nl/carriere/werk-en-leven/gezondheid-stress-burnout/infographic-bewezen-voordelen-van-muziek-bij-het-werk?utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=wk6&utm_campaign=traffic] Can lift mood (upbeat music), non-vocal music good for cognitive tasks. Listening to koan music may increase performance on IQ test. Singing the words can also help learn a new language. [Yanju!] [#NS150314 “Ear genes linked to musical aptitude”] Genetic variations near GATA2-gene and PCDH15 influence one's ability to detect small differences between sound pitch and sound duration. [#NS080815BrainOnMusicKillsPainOfWorkouts] music (like sex and drugs) releases opoids in the brain, so acts as a pain-killer. Dopamine also plays a role in the twin phases of anticipation (of hearing your favourite song) and actually hearing it. Opoids only play a role when actually hearing the music.Note that actively engaging with the music (singing, dancing or drumming) increase the effect, raising the pain threshold (likely also increasing the opoids). Music also affects our immune system (affecting leucocytes, cytokines and immunoglobulins. Also triggers memories, less vividly than other means, but they tend to be happy ones. And can be used to regulate one's mood (get excited or calm down). [#NS230716PerfectHarmony>It'sAMatterOfTaste] Native amazonians don't prefer perfect fifths – preference grows with exposure to western music. [#EW] Like Annie. So learned? Or are perfect harmonies learned easier that wrong ones?

Music lessons: [#EW] Would music lessons (like other 'schoolish lessons') increase IQ because they train the ability of people to pay attention; and would working memory training do the same? So better attention – higher IQ?

Musical ability: [#EricB458] Families producing musicians were emotionally stable, task oriented,, careful in selecting their children's friends, and strongly supported musical activities. Note that singers and jazz musicians seem to start later than 'classical' musicians. Time required per proficiency level differs per instrument, pianists and violinists at the top, singers at the bottom {EW: indication of popularity/competition, or traditions?} Speed of learning particular pieces of music may depend on prior experience with the genre. [#NS310312] Music can help against organ rejection by dampening the immune system, decreasing doses of interleukin-2 and gamma interferon. La Traviata 26 days, Mozart 20 days, Enya 11 days, monotone 7 days.

Musicians: [#Csik74] Male musicians seem less confident about their abilities and arre more anxious about personal attractiveness and peer relations than male science students. [#NS101015MusiciansHaveMirror-likeBrains] corpus callosum seems to be larger in musicians, and if musicians listen to music, the hemispheres (especially the motor cortices) are more likely to fire in sync than that of people with no musical training. Note that the effect was stronger in keyboard players than in string players.

Musturbation: [#Burkem46] Musturbation may be caused by the thought that, instead of merely wanting, say, a relationship with a woman, you need it. Difference between terrible and undesirable. [#Rosenb166] List all your ‘I have to’ and change them to “I choose to do X because I want”

Mutation: [#Franzen42] It has been estimated that it takes about 1000 – 10,000 generations for a new mutation to come into being and to spread throughout the population {EW: does this take (bottleneck) population size into account? Or strength of natural selection?}

Myelin: [#Coyl43] Myelin wraps around a nerve fibre when it fires. As you age, your myelination slows down though, making it more difficult to learn new skills {aunt Ankie's piano lessons?} [#EricB674] Most myelination takes place (or faster!) in childhood. [#EW] Higher IQ is associated with more myelin – learning too. Would higher myelination explain why both high-IQ-people and skilled people use less energy when performing a task, as less energy may be 'leaked out'? [#NS210215MeetYourOtherBrain] Myelin/white matter also increases when you are learning a new skill; also has an impact on learning, next to changes in synapses [so learning is both grey matter and white matter]

Mystery: [#Gold162] If a name of a product is not directly obvious ('kermit green' or 'millenium orange') people will be tempted to ponder it longer and develop more positive feelings for cracking the mystery. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/radical-teaching/201005/want-children-pay-attention-make-their-brains-curious] Mysteries, like giving every day a piece of the puzzle of the next lesson, or doing something weird (radishes on their desk) will make people curious.

Myth: [#JFK/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140407153251-8353952-the-difference-between-successful-and-very-successful-people?trk=eml-mktg-inf-m-top14-1210-p11] “The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.”

nAch: [#EricB157] Need for achievement, a personality trait that is one of the best for predicting achievement, especially as a manager. [#Wiki] nAch is meaningless unless qualified by “need for achievement for something people care about” {EW: this may explain why some parents stressed achievement even while they showed preciously little in their jobs}

Naive realism: [#HaidtH71] I see things as they are, others are biased by ignorance, self-interest or idiology.

Naivity: [#Hargit170] Naivity is very important in a young scientist, as long as you are knowledgeable.

Names: [#Int24022012] Under 500 lawyers, those with the easiest names had the senior positions; if our brain processes something quickly, it gives a nice feeling {EW: why}. [#Strien90] If something (piece of art, scientific paper) comes from a famous person, we tend to have more positive expectations and see it as more creative {EW: and have less criticism?} than if it is of an unknown person.

Naming: [#http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/05/10/learn-anything-in-less-time/] Naming a (learning) project may help, just as setting concrete objectives and boundaries, and setting the challenge level right. (and feedback mechanisms) A fixed schedule (always doing something at a certain time) can also be important.

Naps: [#Medi159] Naps can be healthy and good for concentration. Mid-afternoon is natural nap-time for most people, though some feel it much more strongly than others. [#Loeh58] Napping can greatly increase alertness when taken 20-30 minutes every four hours. More that 30-40 minutes is inproductive as people get into deeper stages of sleep and are groggier than before. ?One hour nap in early afternoon (3-4 pm) seems fine though. [#NS] 5-10 min doze-off however also increases recall.

Narcissism: [#Pers292] Narcissism is a personality trait that has a grandiose facade hiding a deep sense of low-self-esteem, self-esteem being extremely dependent on the admiration or approval of others. Have lots more anger and anxiety after failure. [#Interm, Barbora Nevicka] Narcissist are especially attractive leaders during a crisis, as their self-confidence reduces stress and uncertainty/unrest, however they're generally quite bad leaders, so the choice tends to be counterproductive. [#NS090716AllAboutMe] People judge narcissists as more confident, intelligent and attractive than other people, and are more likely to be offered a job, become leaders, and preferred by the opposite sex. Narcissistic artists sell more and get highter prices for their work. Occurs more often in men than in women. Continuum/Gaussian, 1-2% has narcissistic personality disorder. Big 5: E, O, C low on N and A. Types: vulnerable narcissist and grandiose narcissist. Vulnerable: believe they are special, want to be seen that way, but are not that competent or attractive. Self-esteem fluctuates a lot, Tend to be self-conscious and passive, prone to outbursts of potential violent aggression if their inflated self-image is threatened. Grandiose narcissists' belief that they are superior is unshakeable, even if it is unwarranted. Moderate level of grandiose narcissism is linked to both becoming a leader and being an effective one. But benefits of grandiose narcissicm come mostly from extroversion, downside from lack of agreeableness. Develop narcissicm: spend 10 minutes before interview writing about a time you felt powerful. Also sit up straight (and stand up straight), open posture and take lucky charms. Note that grandiose narcissists can be divided into “narcissic admiration” (driven by hope for success) and “narcissic rivalry” (driven by fear of failure). Note that men are less narcissistic if they enter adulthood during a period of recession. Is cultivated by parents who “overvalue”. [#NS281017It’sAllAboutMe] People who score more highly for narcissism are more likely to also show more ethnic prejudice and believe inequality is natural. However, do not care much about protecting traditional values.

Narrative: [#EW/EricB572] A strong narrative may convince laypersons of the truth of something, some experts (such as historians) are however not as easily fooled. {despite experts being more skilled in constructing narratives!} [#Redirect142] Providing children with the narrative that they are troublemakers (even if it's a side effect of a programme designed to help them) instead of 'I'm a good person' makes them more likely to commit crimes and die earlier.

National Board for Professional Teacher Standards: [#Hatt26] American institution that tests and certifies excellent teachers.

Nations: [#Strien268] There generally has been a dominant nation in scientific production: Italy (1540-1610), England (1660-1730), France (1770-1830) Germany (1810-1920), and the US (1910-present). Half a century before the golden age, there was some change in the philosophical and general view of society (EW: mentors?)

Naturalness: [#HTSWW13] The first few times you try something new, it won't feel natural at all!

Nature: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201005/stepping-outdoors-boosts-mood-self-esteem] Spending 5 minutes a day in nature boosts mood and self-esteem, especially if the exercise is light. [#NS150613] Nature may help because our brains are primed to connect blue water and green trees with resources, triggering restoration response. After 20 minutes in nature, ADHD improves. Creative reasoning improves after several-day hike in nature. Slower heart rate, less cortisol, lower blood pressure. Sight, sounds, and smell (terpenes?) all have some effect. [EW: and nature in schools against ADHD?]

Need for cognition: [#Wiki] Whether people like thinking and solving puzzles. People high in NfC try to analyze situations, people low in it tend to judge on peripheral cues (how attractive or high-status the speaker is). [#Franzen237] Seems related to openness.

Need for power: [#Franzen267] If the execution of someone's need for power is blocked, the person's health suffers. [#Int13012012] Would the need for power be a kind of need for autonomy, and the more autonomy one has (or the less one needs) the less pronounced is the need for power?

Needed: [#Peal179] Being appreciated or needed is important for most people's mental health.

Needs: [#Nati71] Words are learned better (higher motivation) if they are needed to understand or generate a text. [#DeMoor17] People do not only need food, water and shelter, they also have social needs (belonging, affection, friendship, contact with others) and ego needs (respect, acknowledgement, status, prestige) [#SteelArt] Needs are not constant, if they're satiated, they're weakened for a while, letting other needs in the limelight. [#Ryan2000] Autonomy, competence and relatedness. [#Adams112] For problem finding, interview people or imagine yourself the customer: what does he/she/you need? If necessary: small things, like 'the bug list' (rotten oranges, paperless toilets)

Negations: [#NS191209] Telling people to not think about sex arouses them about as much as telling them to think around sex.

Negative capability: [#Greene175] The capability to be in uncertainties, to endure a mystery without reaching for fact and reason [#182] And to be more than ready to find their most cherished opinions contradicted by reality. You may want to enhance it by reading books from unfamiliar writers or in unfamliar fields.

Negative feelings: [#EW] Negative feelings may hamper learning. {?because they tend to either cause tunnel vision, or hinder concentration on the taught subject by diverting the thoughts to other things? Or by sapping willpower?} [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201101/autopsy-the-abandoned-new-years-resolution] They also make people seek immediate enjoyment (Aristippan happiness, or chocolate cake) to feel better [EW: as self-medication? Or 'putting things in balance again?']. [#Switch121] Negative emotions may help if you need a quick and specific action, but not very much for long-term change.

Negative information: [#NS100508] Negative information makes a stronger impact than positive information.

Negative priming: [#Eyse149] Having to pay attention to what you first had to inhibit is hard (Stroop-effect). High P-scorers however don't experience this effect, as they have more trouble inhibiting the (inappropriate) response in the first place!

Negativity: [#Nass49] Optimism sounds superficial, pessimism sounds profound; when people have to present in front of an audience that is described as being higher in intellectual status thanm them, presenters become more negative.

Neglect: [#NRC131110] In our evolutionary past, children who were psychologically neglected simply did not survive; in our safe houses and times, they do. Mother's therefore need to be less attentive to children's needs (nor do children need to be as well able to ask attention from their mothers)

Neighbourhoods: [#NS110613] The 'collective efficacy' helps everything from lower crime rates to smaller death toll when disaster strikes; willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good. Trust and willingness to help their neighbours. (EW: again: environment which we, as in scientific careers, are blind for) [#HaidtH176] One of the best predictors of the health of an American neighborhood is the degree to which adults respond to the misdeeds of other people’s children.

Neocortex: [#GladT?] The size of the neocortex of primates seems to be correlated to their maximum group size (for humans it's about 148 – onveniently 150)

Neocortical activity: [#NS040715] Bad for giving birth (or having sex). Can be reduced by a knitting midwife (repetitive actions decrease adrenalin)

Nernst, Walther: [#Crop124] Traveled as a young man over the various great universities and sought out the best scientists, admired patient Ettinghausen. Made his name not only with his equation, but also wrote large textbook. Was ambitious, and not above driving hard bargains with officials and companies. Immodest, liked to glorify himself, sarcastic, but could be kind to his students, not leaving them to 'sink or swim'. Tried to end the first World war with his connections to the Kaiser among others, disliked the Nazi policies but didn't have the energy or influence to act.

Networking: [#Catmul220] A company can also fertilize cross-disciplinary bounds by having things like Pixar’s “Pixar university”. [#NS160917300-page sumupOfMathsProofBaffles] Shinicji Mochizuki produced proof/'proof' of a + b = c. Unfortunately, the proof was 500 pages long and developed a whole new type of mathematics called inter-universal Teichmuller theory. Mochizuki refuses to travel outside Japan to help explain his work, and his written explanationsn can seem inpenetrable.

Networks: [#Peal128] If you have enough friends and acquiantances, you can contact people with other useful people, and therefore be of use as an intermediary. [#Caree] Networking can also be done via social on-line networks like Hyves. [#Tonn81] Skill in networking is very handy; take a (part time?) job at TV or radio, call people, don't wait for them to call you, make friendship with someone who is already more advanced in 'the world', go to places (cafés and such) where the important people in the field are, take classes at a school that delivers students for theatre etc., or go to a club where professionals play a role as director or such. [#NS260512] On Twitter: use hashtags like #creativity to find other people with similar interests. [#ArjanVanDenBorn] Networking is the only thing that makes you earn more money and makes you happier. [#Imagine202] Most entepreneurs have quite some friends, but all came from the same places and were interested in the same things; very few weak ties. Business people with entropic networks full of weak ties were three times more innovative than people with small networks or close friends. Israel helps as Israeli under the age of 45 are required to serve several weeks a year. [#206] We get smart by being around other smart people. [#Nass179] The star performers at Bell Labs were more effective at getting their work done by building and using their informal networks – they cultivated relationships with a wide range of people. Others, even if e-mailing experts, often did not get a response.

Networks of enterprise: [#Root] The most successful scientists had hobbies, the least successful too, but the most successful integrated their hobbies into their science, didn't see them as completely separate or unrelated. [#Ster105] Van Gogh's networks of enterprise were religion and art, one shifting into another {EW: so my broad interests would be storytelling, psychology, education, excelling?} Darwin started separate notebooks on geology and the transmutation of species at the same day; so obviously worked on different projects at the same time, his evolution notebook splitting up later into different new enterprises (such as continuity between homo sapiens and other animals). [#Ster218] Have components of knowledge, purpose and affect. [#Strien304] Can shift or narrow during one's lifespan. [#Stalla128] There are six different networks: work, social, innovation, expert knowledge, career guidance/strategic, learning x hubs (people with many connections), pulsetakers  (people who know the right people; don’t know as many as hubs, but can quickly get an overview of what is going on) and gatekeepers (who protect part of the network or information). [map by asking people whom people communicate with and what they communicate about]

Neumann, John von: [#NS230814MusicAndTheMakingOfModernScience] Had little interest in music, except in playing grammophone records of marching bands.

Neural connections: [#http://www.wisconsinacappella.com/what-can-make-a-genius-bbc-horizon/] our brain has many 'dormant' neural connections, allowing us to learn faster (to see from sound) than nerves could grow [EW: so pruning is not fully, and may just be deactivating/withering things]

Neural networks: [#NS050817AiTrickedIntoSeeingWhat’sNotThere] Neural networks can be fooled by subtly altering the image; people cannot, so we really don’t understand how neural networks work, but definitely not the same as human brains.

Neural processing: [#Laird96] In the brain, algorithms seem to work since neurons are arranged in certain patterns, activating/strengthening related patterns and inhibiting completing patterns. This will lead eventually to a convergence 'relaxation', the 'glove fits'.

Neural rewiring/neuroplasticity: [#Davidson168] People blind from birth have a visual cortex that is involved in verbal memory, it also processes nouns to produce the correct verbs. But even volunteers deprived of sight for five days start to use the visual cortex for tactile stimulation; probably there are already some connections between the visual cortex and all other senses. People with strokes are sometimes helped by not being allowed to use their 'good' arm for a few weeks, which greatly increases the functionality of the 'useless' arm. [#http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24831-learning-drugs-reawaken-grownup-brains-inner-child.html#.VO8Gz47lzbM] In critical periods, brains loses certain plasticity, may be related to histone deacetylase. Valproate can help with that (for example with learning perfect pitch). In general, if critical periods are timed too early or too late you can get things like autism, which are a mismatch in coordination between the development and linking of different brain circuits.

Neural substrate: [#EricB564] The place where a skill is first learned; finger counting brain regions usually form the neural substrate for maths {EW could this be changed/improved with other education?}

Neureguline 1: [#Int080612] A specific variant of neureguline 1 is associated with creativity and schizophrenia.

Neurofeedback: [#NS100710] Training volunteers to boost their gamma waves by monitoring the brain waves helps them with abstract reasoning. [#NS210712] Also useful for actors, musicians, and hand-eye coordination of surgeons (improved control over their movement, more efficient in the operating theatre). Possible use for sports, to get brain in state of attention, focus and aim {or for scientists- creativiy?}

Neurologists: [#Bloo348] Parents were very busy/active in work and community. Always stressed academic achievement and going to college, having a profession was ideal; secure future and autonomy. Stressed doing work one loves more than specific career aspirations. Children were very busy and loved being read to. Parents were supportive in buying educational things. Started more by imitating things than by being creative. Typically were busy children, had variety of activities (though most gave up on playing musical instruments after a few years because they didn't enjoy it. They did play sports as kids, though) “Don't get involved in something you really don't like” was the parent's motto {different for musicians?}. Some parents were absent, other parents loved scientific discussions over the dinner table and playing the devil's advocate. Internalized the statement that whatever they wanted to do, they could do. Whatever they wanted to be, they could be. Initial difficulties could be overcome with time and perseverance. Were encouraged to have many different interests and switch from them [difference between neurologists and mathematicians was that mathematicians didn't like instructions or directions very much] Hobbied in science during adolesence. Often read scientific american. Best teachers in high school were those that strove for excellence and didn't mess around – high standard teachers, as well as enthousiastic teachers. Bad teachers didn't know their subjects or didn't allow students to do a lot on their own. Most students played sports quite fanatically. After that, school government or social organizations. Were able to juggle many interests in their schedules. Became independent learners, learned that if they started on something, resources would appear. In college, followed lots of science courses and liked the liveliness and greater tolerance for sloppiness of the biological sciences. Stayed widely interested, though sports interests waned. Most had some research experience in college, and thought it much fun. But still were not singleminded researchers. Most chose medical school to leave their options open (research, medicine, teaching...) Often thought more highly of research and discovering/inventing things than of just being a doctor. Differed from normal science graduates by not being as single minded, and mixing interests in thinking with those in doing. Also, they were quite interested in people. But it was more eliminating choices than being pulled into a definite direction. In med school they sampled lots of courses, but gradually converged on neurology; it was a hot new area, very versatile and also intellectually challenging (and relatively little competition!). Great teachers/role models also helped determine their direction to neurology. Started by reproducing research or following instructions, to learn the techniques and such. Lots of emphasis on critical thinking though. Peers also often were a positive influence. Some slowly started to focus.

Neuromodulary systems: [#Kluw60] In contrast to fast neurotransmitters, such as GABA, glycine and glutamate, neuromodulators such as serotonin, dopamine, noradrenalin and acetylcholin work in the order of seconds, and make neurons more or less sensitive for the action of neurotransmitters. The noradrenergic system: general activation of emotional and cognitive centers, general attention, and early stress response. Serotonin has the same connections, but the inverse effect, causing a sense of relaxation and pleasure.

Neuromodulators: [#NS060413] Kind of volume control, regulating the amount of neurotransmitters released at synapses. Some help fine-tune brain activity to immediate events, others rewire the brain for the longer term, may explain how memories are stored.

Neuronal habituation: [#Weng17] Giving your nervous system the same signals time and again lulls them to sleep. Visualisation can remedy that by activating other brain cells.

Neuronal plasticity: [#Kluw32] While sensory areas, motor areas and auditory areas of the cortex seem to respond to training by growing, visual areas seem to rely more on faster firing rates and different firing patterns. Cells can change by changes in cell body volume, number and strength of synapses, and dendritic trees {?} [#Kluw40] Not only the neurons receiving the signal can adapt when they don't receive a signal anymore, it seems that at least in some cases the 'sending' neuron notices when it doesn't have a 'listener' anymore and can rearrange itself as well.

Neurons: [#Medi57] Neurons can break connections, glide over to a different neuron, strengthen connections, or split their dendrites. [#NS230213] Slips of the tongue are more common between vowels and vowels and consonants and consonants, possibly because vowels and consonants occupy entirely different regions of the brain. [#NS050113] Neurons active for animals cluster closely, as do animals and vehicles. Gallantlab.org/semanticmovies. {EW: actually, each concept activates (and deactivates) many different regions simultaneously, though similar concepts (de)activate similar regions. [#NS060713] Neurons (at least those in the dACC) can be active even 24 hours after their stimulation (even a bit more strongly). [Would this gell with 'seeding' a problem in the brain?] May only work for a really meaningful thought, though. [#NS050817Brain box: Multitasking chips that can match the human mind] Spike time plasticity: a synapse only strengthens when yhje neurons fire at similar times; if they fire out of sync, the connection weakens. [#NS020917ChangingYourMind] Oestradiol ramps up the activity of the mitochondria in the brain, helping deal with the wear and tear of ageing. In the menopause, oestradiol diminishes, shifting metabolism to fats (especially myelin!) This shift away from glucose metabolism is also found in Alzheimer’s.

Neuroproshesis: [#NS110415] You can make blind rats feel electromagnetic fields by connecting a kind of compass to their cortex; in principle you could make people sense things they could not ordinarily sense.

Neuroticism: [#Eyse244] Neuroticism is helpful in art, not very useful or even hampering for a scientific career. {EW: does neuroticism influence how easily something is remembered, as things seem more important to a neurotic?} [#Gosl53] High scorers on neuroticism tend to be jittery and nervous, sensitive about what others think of them (self-conscious) and prone to depression. Difficulties in impulse control. Panic more easily when under pressure. [#Zill128] Do neurotics prefer embarrassing stimuli, leading to autonomic arousal, but blocking of cortical arousal? [#Nett112] Neuroticism is seen in the amygdala being more responsive to negative stimuli, and also having a higher baseline level. Negative feelings are often directed towards self. Also instability in self-concept ('who am I?') Can also lead to innovation, as well as workaholicism, and leads to better academic results when coupled with high ego strength (C/self-discipline). Weak positive predictor for success in professional occupations, as neurotics reflect more and may make more realistic plans.

Neutralizing thoughts: [#EW091211] Negative feelings can often be made softer by 'neutralizing thoughts' (like: “I spent much more time on Tarm than on this”), which probably calms down attention from the stressful factor and gives relief.

Newton, Isaac: [#Crop18] The object of Newton's study could become an obsession for him, possessing him nonstop, even leaving him without food or drink or sleep. But often left alone a subject without publication. Aptitude for creating mechanisms. Though sometimes revisited a subject in later decades. Was introverted, avoiding fellow students, tutor, and most of the curriculum. DID create his own notebook for his own 'philosophical investigations' though, in which he listed the (many) questions which interested him. Newton could be quite vehement and dirty in fighting scientific opponents however, not displaying a great amount of tact or flexibility in such cases. Was neurotic, and at least once succumbed to breakdown. Led a self-centered, eccentric life, had no sense of humor. Einstein remarked Newton's joy of creation and minute precision. [#Strien275] Claimed that he made his important discoveries by “thinking on them continuously”. [#293] Was likely even before his breakdown a 'schizoide querulant with paranoid characteristics' [#321] May have felt special since people believed that children born without a father were predestined to something great, AND he was born on the first day of Christmas. Sort of mission to 'doorgronden God's plan' [but did not brook rivalry in that!] [#NS230814MusicAndTheMakingOfModernScience] Newton reportedly walked out of the only opera he ever attended, but his notebooks show he studied music.

Nightmares: [#NS300416TheUpsideOfNightmares] People with more frequent nightmares also have more positive dreams, and have more empathy and creativity than the average control.

Nirenberg, Marshall: [#Hargit164] Loved science - Was wholly immersed in science to the exclusion of everything else.

NMDA receptor”: [#NS150314 “Erase your fear...”] Involved in learning. Low-doses of D-cycloserine seem to enhance the learning process, possibly making exposure therapy to combat phobias more efficient.

No problem: [#Myst38] Don't make big deals out of anything and repeat “no problem” in your head until you believe it.

Nobel prize: [#Hargit78] Cram considered three components important for a Nobel prize: doing exceptional research, bringing them to the 'scientific market place' (publishing them and giving seminars all over the world), and third: longevity. [#201] Getting a Nobel prize may decrease ardent pursuit of pure science (perhaps unless you're very competitive). Other factor may be the addictiveness of the new-found fame? Melvin Schwarz was however lured back to academia by his prize. Sanger simply retired at 65 and has since been into gardening, not making any statements about politics, art, or literature. Limits are that it is limited by some politics/avoiding controversy, pragmatics (are there sufficiently few people who have made the discovery)

Nobel, Alfred: [#NRC011011] Stubborn, independent, unbound/unmarried, sickly {EW: low A?}, disliked lawyers, traveled a lot.

Nobelitis: [#Hargit77] Scientists getting nervous and distracted near the Nobel prize announcements.

nocebos: [#NS14102017ExpensiveNocebosHurtMore] Expensive nocebos cause more pain.

Noice & Noice: [#EricB493] Psychologists studying actors, wrote a book about the memory/cognitive methods actors use. Such as self-referencing and experiencing the emotions with the lines. Experiencing on cognitive, affective and motoric levels helps better than just on cognitive levels {?multimodal, but with feelings?}”Active experiencing principle” <also helps older adults>

Noise: [#Ster74] Noise interferes with writing poems, and more severly if it is unpredictable and intelligible.[#Scho166] Both acoustical insulation of the workspace as developing interest in the noise (talk to the builders!) help diminish its impact on work. [#NS021010] White noise helps inattentive kids learn, but decreases the performance of normal kids. {EW: why?}

Non-intellectual pursuits: [#Ster437] Sidis' parents considered all non-intellectual pursuits as wasteful, whereas Wiener's father at least took his son on long walks.

Non-linear: [#Robi192] Ones career is not always a straight clear line. Ridley Scott was a lithographer, who started doing small jobs for the BBC, after a few years they sent him on a directing course.

Non-parametrical statistics: methods to prevent Bayesian statistics from becoming so overloaded that the values of some parameters do not matter anymore, and you can't find out truth (or a good approximation of the truth), no matter how much you experiment.

Noninstrumental: [#PinkDrive128] If you don't do 'needless'/noninstrumental/playful things, you'll grow tense, restless, easily fatigued, irritable, and get disturbed sleep in a few days.

Nonjudgmental: [#Gall13] Learning to be nonjudgmental about your performance is essential to effectively improve it.

Nonverbal ideas: [#EW/RootBernstein] Would ideas that cannot be expressed in words be somewhere in a neuron/neuronal group that is not immediately linked to vocabulary, just to other concepts, making explanation difficult.

Nonverbal Learning Disorder: [#Wiki] Difficulty in learning motoric and social skills, often diagnosed as (symptom of?) Asperger's; thought to reside in less-developed right hemisphere or worse interhemispheric coordination. Anxiety may be the result (also because of overwhelm by the world)

Norephinephrine: [#EOS, dec 2004] Exam stress increases learning/retention on a test for remembering and reproducing numbers, but decreases flexible thinking and problem solving. Researchers think that this is linked to norephinephrine levels in the brain. [#NS250212] People with the lowest noradrenalin levels (because of a higher number of noradrenalin transporters) were least cautious about losing money.  [#NS100617DrugBoostsSelfCOnfidence] Reducing noradrenalin levels boosts people’s metacognitive insight, making people more accurate in whether their guess was correct. Lower noradrenalin levels may help against OCD and schizophrenia. Likely mechanism is that noradrenalin (EW: stress?) after an uncertain decision can erase memories, making the memories less reliable in assessing their decision.

Norm diffusion: [#EW] It seems that underprivileged children do best when classes are differentiated as late as possible (14-15 years or later). It could be that extra challenge makes them grow more, or that they absorb some of the study tactics and self-confidence of their classmates (after all, those prove that asking questions is not met with ridicule).

Normal: [#Greene283/EW] Cattle ranchers found injuries and deaths of cattle during dips 'normal', even though they turned out totally avoidable by Grandin's designs. Similar for pupureal fever and education dropouts?

Norms: [#Zill103] Teens seeing pre/extra/nonmarital sex on TV rate it as significantly less bad than teens seeing 'legitimate' sex. [#Redirect163] Communicating (true?) social norms is a helpful part of a story-editing approach. We all have perceptions about what the people who we care about are doing, and what they'd want us to do. Even when no-one is around to twist our arms, we are subject to imaginary arm-twisting by conforming to what we think others would want us do. [#168] Best predictor of drinking is how much someone thinks his or her peers drink, not how much those actually drink. [#172] Descriptive vs injunctive norms (what people do, and what people approve or disapprove of in a given situation) [#Sommers89] Breaking norms always has social repercussions, ranging from awkwardness to social exclusion. But an ally can help us break the norms, whether it is someone agreeing with us in an Asch-like experiment, or a Cameron Hughes. Conformity also drops when our statement is not publically scrutinized (Asch-writing down).

Nostalgia: [#NS240916WistfulThinking] Nostalgia is antidote to loneliness, not its cause. Springs up when we are feeling low, and in general boosts well-being.  Reflecting forges bonds with other people, enhances positive feelings and self-esteem, boosts optimism and inspires people to pursue their goals. Also increases perceptions of purpose in life. Nostalgia is also ramped up when confronted with existential questions (meaning of it all) – when people feel uncertain, uncomfortable or unsure. High levels of collective nostalgia promote group bonding, at the cost of distrusting outsiders like immigrants. Anticipatory nostalgia seems however counterproductive.

Nostaligic experiences: [#Lyubom209] Nostalgic experiences spawn positive feelings, reinforce our sense of being loved and protected, and boost our self-esteem.

Note-taking: [#Watt61] Make notes of things that you do not understand at first, you may understand them later. And make them large and clear! You may even use colours, if it helps. [#Pino57] Make notes in class as if you're a journalist who has to report to his or her paper. [#Clar124] Note-taking increases the comprehension of signaled content (emphasis, summaries), but decreases the comprehension of unsignaled content due to cognitive overload {EW: probably in case of novices} [#Clar226] Notes are most useful as references; in class it can lead to split attention, and costs time without increasing learning. It's therefore best if the instructor gives handouts. Taking notes from text (in own words) does however increase understanding, as in self-pacing, split attention is not so much a problem. [#Hatt191] Note taking seems to help less skilled learners, but not more-skilled learners. Instructor's notes are superior, and reviewing notes helps more than taking notes.

Notebook: [#http://thetalentcode.com/2014/08/27/24-rules-for-becoming-an-adult-prodigy/] Keep a notebook!

Novelty: [#Medi76] Novel stimuli almost automatically draw attention {EW: Bayesian brain?} [#Ster42] Attraction to novelty also correlates with creativity. (which is odd, since novelty also causes cortical arousal. Suggested [#Ster145]: they can handle it because they have just lowered arousal by withdrawing from the world, and they mainly like mental novelty, not physical adventures.) [#EricB669] Novel objects stimulate the PF neurons more, but when the object becomes more familiar, the neurons become more 'tuned' and specifically activated.

Novilo: [#schoolproject06022013] OCW specificeert WAT geleerd moet worden, niet HOE. <tip voor Tijl: lees Switch; en als je doet wat anderen doen, betekent dat je in elk geval geen idioot bent (Wisdom of Crowds)> Ouders kunnen risicomijdend zijn: domme keus kan rampzalig zijn voor hun kind.

Nucleus accumbens: [#Hooked96] Is also triggered by a bargain.

Nudge: [#NS130413] Putting messages like that abusing your teammates decreases winning chances itself reduces abuse by 11%. Read the book? Other examples: attic insulation scheme has much more success if a free attic cleaning service is included, saying that most people in your area pay their tax on time, or telling people which energy-saving measures their neighbours were taking [stronger than leaflets showing them how much money they could save]. Works since we are often follow the herd instead of making decisions to suit ourselves. We favour the status quo even if it is not in our best interests. “How will you go to the voting station”.

Nurture: [#Evans28] If animals are taught a language by humans, the complexity of that language is greater than that of their fellow-animals[soortgenoten] in the wild.

Nutrition: [#PoorEcon31] Children given deworming regularly have a greater chance to finish school and earn, as young adults, 20% more.

Obesity: [#080111] Obesity shrinks the brain, perhaps by causing lots of low-level inflammation; possiby also shrinking the orbitofrontal cortices, involved in impulse control {but what is cause?}

Obeying: [ [#NS270216WhyPeopleCanBeSoEasilyCoerced] If people do something voluntarily, they perceive the time delay between their action and the outcome to be shorter than if they are obeying orders. Longer perceived time can therefore serve as marker for a reduced sense of agency, or control. Possibly they mentally distance themselves from the order?

Object inversion: [#EricB668] Object inversion can be seen for items where one has expertise (so when a stimulus becomes more familiar, processing is shifted to other areas, like the right FFA), where recognition of the upside-down object is much slower than for the upright object. Examples are faces (which activate much more the object area when inverted) or other things where an individual has particular expertise (birds, cars, dinosaurs?). Prosopagnosia patients don't show the object inversion effect for faces, for example.

Objective: [#Stol70] If learners know what they are supposed to learn, there's a better chance they will learn it (research suggests that at least). Performance objectives are better if they are more concretely verifyable without becoming obsessive or trivial.

Objectivity: [#Watt57] Try to look at things from 'far away' – try to disentangle your interests and passions from them, so you can see them more clearly for what they are {EW: for thinking about things later, sometimes your passions may be useful to impress them on memory} [#CIAch4] Objectivity is best achieved not by not making any assumptions, but my making your assumptions explicit. [#Sommers9] When we look at situations objectively, detaching ourselves from the emotion and bias that often cloud our vision, we're better able to pick up on the clues that allow us to understand other people and achieve the outcomes we seek (airport voucher)

Observation: [#Wolt15] What we observe (and subsequently store in memory) depends on our wishes and needs. {reticular formation?} [#Gall23] Often we just 'know' something intellectually (that we swing our backhand too low, for example) but only really notice it and start to do something about it when we observe it ourselves (in a mirror, for example). [#Weng?/EW] Focusing on observation, instead of interpretation ('what that fact means') may clear the way for a more accurate interpretation of the situation than merely deducing the situation from the first fact that comes into mind. [#Greene147] Incidence of pupureal fever was much higher among women who had their babies delivered by a doctor relative to a midwife – some people had noticed that, none could explain it, and few were perturbed by it! [EW: why!?] [#CoyleT5] Much time in talent hotbeds is spent at observing/staring at top performers (like hungry cats). [#Weiner81] Would genius be roorted in observation, unencumbered by assumptions and expectations? [#Ashton6/EW] Did Edmond observe, wonder why and experiment? We may pay too little attention to most things. Do0 we experiment? Take time to improve and test our tools?

Observing: [#Root03] The first thinking tool. All humans sense the world, of course, but observing is a skill that takes additional patience, concentration and curiosity. {Darwin loved to observe nature and people, Faraday things... so what you like to observe may give information about your career} [#Watt53] We can always observe, whether ourselves, our own life, our company or whatever things surround us. {EW: would better observing enhance motivation since things seem newer to you? In any case, when drawing you see much more. But it may not invoke curiosity if you don't see gaps}[#Gall26] Observing what is is much better than thinking on what you should do. [#Hargit91] While C60-peaks were clearly visible in early mass spectrograms, the scientists did not notice them. Later researchers varied the experimental conditions and gave the peak a structure and a name [EW: giving it an identity, to float or falter] “Research is to see what everyone has seen and to think what noone has thought”. [#Strien153] Better observations [when measurements progress] may topple held theories ; it needed superior astronomical observations to make Copernicus conquer the Ptolemaic models.

Obsession: [#Crop30] “I keep [a] subject constantly before me, and wait till the first dawnings open slowly, by little and little, into a full and clear light.” - Newton. Newton could not really perform any task superficially – even not the formal administration of the Mint.[#Pers286] Obsessions might arise when people feel that they lack control in their lives. [#Jaff2] Obsession did drive Trevisano. But perhaps it was even a kind of addiction, even when swearing to leave it alone, he returned to gold-making.

Obstacles: [#Weiner200] Obstacles may be opportunities since they can stimulate us to 'switch tracks'.

Occupational level: [#EricB158] The occupational level corresponds to how much challenge one desires in ones job.

OCD: [#EW] Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Some famous people (like Darwin and Proust) are believed to have suffered from OCD. Could slight OCD help one to perservere practicing / focusing on one area? [#Davidson173] OCD characterized by hyperactivity in orbital frontal cortex, that notices when something is amiss, and in the striatum, which receives input from the orbital frontal cortex and the amygdala. OFC+striatum form 'worry circuit'. Can be treated with mindfulness meditation, patient thinking “It's just my faulty circuit producing another faulty thought”. This also actually reduces the activity in the OFC after a few weeks. [#NS150314”OCDmakespeople behave like gamblers”] Both OCD and drug/gambing addicts perform poorly on a test where 2 stacks of cards gave large wins but even larger losses; lack of control over behaviour (anxiety when stopping?). High anxiety? N-acylcysteine, which helps gambling addiction, may also help in OCD. [#NS160116] Like people with Tourette's syndrome and drug abuse problems, OCD sufferers may have disruptions in the neural circuits between the cortex and the striatum. OCD-sufferers are more vulnberable to 'slips of action'. [#NS120817SeeingOthersWashTheirHandsBringsOCDRelief] Seeing others wash their hands brings OCD sufferers relief, perhaps because their mirror neurons are activated.

OCPD: [#Nett147] Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder; kind of extreme C, a control freak unable to diverge from a set plan (in contrast to ADHDers). Disjunction between means and ends. Perfectionism. Not allowing themselves any fun or leisure time. Miserly, may clutter their homes. May get eating disorders (when female?)

Odd request: [#Lieb130] Rather ask for 37 cents than 25 cents, if people are curious or forced to think, it's more difficult to ignore the request or automatically refuse.

Odds: [#McKee6] Rather than agonizing over the odds (or second-guessing the market), put your energy into producing something excellent.

Oil curse: [#Weiner90] Other name for 'paradox of plenty' – wealth breeds stagnation and lack of innovation.

Olympia Academe: [#Strien299] Olympia Academe, but also Polya was member of the Galilei kring, Bohr of Ekliptika.. between 20 and 25 may be a critical period.

On-screen agents: [#Clar180] On-screen agents help learning. Simple drawn agent works as well as realistic model, but must serve useful instructional purpose, and preferably use audio and sound conversational. Note that it is often possible to achieve learning purposes by having agents ask and answer questions in a dialog, rather than letting the agent ask questions and the person answer it.

One percent-rule: [#SellHuman152] Don't get lost in the crabgrass: think about the essence of what you are exploring: the one percent that gives life to the other 99%.

One thing at a time: [#Fors17] Unsuccessful people are most often not unsuccessful because they are lazy, but because they dilute their attention over too many things.

One-on-one-communication: [#Csik92] Talented teenagers spend more time in smaller groups, or doing one-on-one communication by writing letters or making phone calls.

Oneline education: [#NRC090913] Students starting online education are more motivated and prepared than students following traditional education, but quit more often (12% vs 7%) and got lower grades (2.52 compared to 2.85, scale 0 to 4). Though problems seem to occur mostly for worse students and students from minorities.

Oostrom, Frits van: [#Busa44] Grew up in academic family between books, could always buy all books he wanted (even though his parents weren't rich). Also wrote a lot (entire school newspapers). His Dutch teacher sent him to look at non-fiction (Oostrom said he had lots of mentors), prof. dr. Wim Gerritsen (Medieval studies) inspired him at university. Has very high self-discipline and level of energy (can work from 5 am to 12 pm for months to finish a book). Is always a bit uncertain, so never trusts doing things on routine. And has some need of external validation. Loves to create things.

Open: [#Schmid87] Having open software products can be helpful; as Bill Joy (Sun) said: “no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.”

Open gates: [#Newport94] Opportunities to build (career) capital that are already open for you.

Open office: [http://eab.sagepub.com/content/34/3/279] Lowered motivation, creativity, more sick days: people are interrupted more often, which is bad for productivity and creativity, and have little control over their environment (temperature and such), and employees start to get annoyed by/dislike each other. Main cause seems to be sound pollution.

Open question: [#Edu] Asking open questions of children (what do you think will happen) and asking them to create maps and talk to people and do things and predict what will happen helps their language

Open-presence meditation: [#Davidson184] Meditation that involves awareness of what is the dominant object in your mind at this time.

Openness: [#Mehr154] Correlates positively with grades, together with conscientousness. [#Simo135] Openness to new experiences is thought to be determined for 35-40% by genes, 5% by shared environment and 35% by non-shared environment, especially birth order (latter-born children are more open). [#Pers363] Openness seems to be correlated to general cognitive ability, and perhaps because of that linked to the “greatness” in presidents. [#Hatt3] Many 'how to books' for teachers may not work because teachers often have many theories of education themselves that they're very convinced of [or because it is unclear how the ideas could be implemented?] [#Nett184] Openness is a good predictor of interest in cultural activities of all kinds; it's not that they read books but hate musea or theatre or music.Further openness is associated with broad associations of meanings, restless unconventionality, supernatural beliefs and psychosis-like experiences. Also suggests willingness to express beliefs that go against the 'mores' and likeliness to make career shifts. [#EW210613] Is it ease of making far connections? Or more tolerance – wider range of 'attraction' vs 'disgust' at new things? [#EW] Would openness, due to the loads of diverse links it produces, make learning more fun, let new things cause more brain activation? <and thus prevent specialisation> [#Maladaptively High and Low Openness: The Case for Experiential Permeability] Problems of high openness include a preoccupation with fantasy and daydreaming, eccentric

Openness of test result: [#McK] Openness of test result of schools can be a bad idea, as schools will try to 'teach to the test' then to excel and put even more pressure on teachers and students; they may try to appear to improve, especially if they don't have the resources to actually improve.

Operant conditioning: [#Grin110] Fifth of nine learning methods. A certain (naturally?) occurring behaviour, the operant, is either rewarded or punished. When rewarded, the behaviour's frequency goes up, with punishment, the frequency goes down (though back to normal when punishment is discontinued!). Different schemes of reinforcement are possible, fixed and variable. Big name: Skinner. See also shaping. [#Kluw270] Pavlovian/classical conditioning lets an US follow an external CS; instrumental/operant conditioning lets the US follow a certain behaviour of the animal.

Opinions: [#EW] Having a different opinion than other people signals to many that they are either stupid or at least ignorant, which is not a nice feeling to have (incompetence). [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2011/de-paradox-van-het-delen.html?utm_source=120131-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=de-paradox-van-het-delen&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] It seems that while people tend to adjust their opinion to that of others whose opinions are like their own, there will never be one common opinion, since there are 'zuilen' who are relatively isolated from one another. [#ThePersuadersJamesGarvey] Our opinions are more shaped by our in-group allegiances than by logic and reason.;

Oppenheimer, Robert: [#Crop359] Good teacher and theorist, was interested in everything and knew what the important problems were. Truly lived and struggled with those problems.

Opponent: [#Whit7] Your opponent in tennis is really your friend if he makes you stretch and run.

Opportunism: [#Greene213] Since humans are opportunist animals, would that explain why we require constant stimulation and diversity? Greene says that people like Ramachandran don't strive for a great goal, but seize upon small opportunities that can give great yields. [EW: still I'm convinced that if you had a great goal, like solving world hunger, you could make strides towards that; similar to the Wright brothers flying. There IS a danger, though, that great sizes cause great politicking, and that the noble goal is lost in the clash of ego's]

Opportunities: [#Fors74] Opportunities are dangerous, as they can dilute 'sticking through' with something. Especially in network marketing you should beware of the 'next great opportunity'; in most cases persisting in your current endeavour is the key to success. [#Syed18] Most factors influencing the Matthew effect and such are essentially opportunities (or lack thereof) of strenuous practice. [#Strien35] Opportunity (a good social climate, ripe for some innovation, 'hidden gap') helps, it may be partly luck that someone has the right skill at a time that a market opens, but lots of initiative are also required. [#McGon93] Sometimes the mind gets so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal (like buying salad) that it mistakes the opportunity with the satisfaction of having actually accomplished the goal (leading to the licensing effect). Thinking that we can have the same choice in the future makes it worse!

Opportunity cost: [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7351/pdf/474275a.pdf] Most people forget about the opportunity cost of a decision, and buy sooner when choosing between 'buy or don't buy' than if the choice is between 'buy or save the money for something else'.

Opportunity perception: [#EW] May be the mirror of risk perception: an activity may be seen as having a greater value/chance of success if the person feels in control, the opportunity is vivid/dramatic/easily imaginable (pop star, actor), and the prize is very big (winning a 27 million lottery).

Opposition: [#Eyse147] Good ideas in science are often opposed; especially when they come from outsiders, don't provide a good causal explanation, or are sabotaged by their unpolitical creators. One needs great intrinsic motivation to succeed! The typical genius is a fighter, he has to, because of the corrupt and shortsighted orthodoxy. If there is an established gap, acceptance is easier (Einstein). [#John54] Opposition can also be a kind of creative collaboration, prompting more accurate definitions and better research. [#Crop26] Newton was forced into polemics when Hooke didn't believe his paper {so geniuses indeed must be willing to fight to get their ideas accepted}.

Optimism: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201008/how-pessimism-can-make-you-rich] People generally overestimate the power of their intentions, and underestimate the challenges ahead <tend not to seek sufficient information, for example> However, NO such bias exists when people are asked to estimate other people's chance of success (they generally recommend help for those). {EW: seems amenable to mental trick} [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200909/the-virtue-pessimism] Optimism can be dangerous when changing behaviour, as you're more easily disappointed and give up. However, it works if it's coupled to high self-efficacy and realistic optimism (so not expecting huge effects at once). [#Redirect67] Can be enhanced by writing, for four days for 20 consequtive minutes, about “how everything has gone as well as it possibly could” and your life dreams have become true. [#Flourish192] Optimism reduces death rate (at least in older people). Optimism and pessimism still have their effects if depression is held constant. Being high in positive emotion is more important for preventing colds than being low in negative emotion (though that also makes a slight difference). Higher Positive emotion, the lower interleukin-6. People with a genuine smile live seven years longer than those without the smile. [#206] Optimists give up smoking, pessimists not. People with high life satisfaction (which correlates to optimism) are more likely to diet and exercise and not smoke. Strangers also hang up on a depressed voice faster than on a cheerful voice. Older optimists also have a stronger immune response (T-cells – telomers?) [#191] More optimism, less CVD!

Optimist: [#Pers254] Optimists live 19% longer than pessimists, as they have better immune systems, more friends, and persist longer in healthy pursuits. However, when the consequences of failure are huge (such as drunk driving), it's better to be a pessimist.

Optimizers: [#EricB431] Optimizers may both pay too much in time needed to make a decision, and get too much turmoil over the possibility of failing to pick the best alternative.

Options: [#Whit61] The quantity of options generated for solving a problem is more important than the quality of each specific option.

Orbitofrontal cortex: [#Kluw60] Part of brain involved in social and emotional aspects of behaviours, but also divergent thinking. May be the part damaged in Damasio's patient.

Orchid hypothesis: [#NS28012012] Genes like “SERT” (short) “MAO” and “7R” do not seem to be 'risk-genes', but sensitivity genes; children with the normal variants do similar when parenting is bad or good, children with the risk variants are much worse when parenting is bad, and much better when parenting is good, and respond more to special interventions [EW: even educational ones?] Most came into being relatively recently in history, and therefore seem to have been selected for [better learning = good?].

Order: [#Bran139] Ordering information that goes into memory may have two advantages: by 'coupling' related information (like a list of countries) you repeatedly stimulate the same memory structure, which may help {though repeating the effect too long may be counterproductive). Also, you may use episodic memory, which can help recall things better than pure semantic memory can. [#Who Wants to go First? Order Effects Within a Series of Competitive Sales Presentations] Me-too products are best placed last (recency effect), Market leader both profits from being placed last and from being placed first. Though me-too can profit from using 'agenda-selling' strategy, setting a number of criteria and eliminating all products that don't meet the criteria.

Ordered sequence: [#Fors80] Together with putting distance between you and a task, having an ordered sequence of tasks is indispensable, else putting distance only means procrastinating to make an impulse a random and more urgent impulse at a later date.

Organisational projects: [#Fors180] Organisational projects have an end-goal: split them up in smaller parts and recycle unfinished tasks every day until you're done.

Organisations: [#Adams151] Best if people in organisations rotate, so that there cannot be isolated fiefdoms of R&D and implementation. [#Stalla37] Beware ‘caste system’ of stars, core employees, and strugglers. The main difference between core employees and star employees is not that star employees are that more competent, but that they are less likely to call attention to themselves and less likely to leave for greener pastures, and are quietly dedicated to their work and teammates. Though they may also be ‘go-to’-persons and truth tellers. [#Hofste244] PDI and UAI most important in organisations. Organizations are much more about different practices than about different values. Shared practices also neessary to make organization possible. 6 dimensions: process vs result-oriented (avoiding risks, routinen days, limited effort), employee (interest in employees) vs job-oriented,, parochial vs professional (identify with company vs occupation), open vs closed system (easy for newcomers to feel at home) loose control vs tight control (humor, meetings may run over time), normative vs pragmatic (laws or ethics or results ‘what the customer wants’). Usually people’s values don’t change after they enter organizations, any match is more because of self-selection. Labor intensive jobs tend to be result oriented, in contrast to capital intensive jobs. Result oriented further associated with lower absenteism, flatter organisations, top management coming from the ranks. More job oriented if performance vs profits iso budget, more employee oriented if controversial news is shared by management. More women in the company cause a more open culture. Tight control results in more absenteeism. Note that there can be cultural rifts between different parts of the organisation – this can be dangerous.

Orientation principle: [#EW22112011] If you ask the right questions (e.g: what's important now?) you're likely to get useful answers. The difficulty is finding those questions in the first place.

Orienting: [#Boekaerts10] First phase of learning is orienting: what do I want to learn? Then planning, monitoring, reflection.

Orienting phase: [#Parr49] Studying would generally have three phases: an orienting phase in which one wants a global overview of the area, the essential phase in which one looks for the core ideas, and the detail phase in which one fills in the ideas.

Orphans-effect: [#EWL] Much more eminent people were (half)orphaned earlier than a control group; especially politicians, and to a lesser extent, sporters and scientists, seem to show it. Enrico Fermi lost his beloved brother, which may also count here.

Oscillations: [#Kluw201] Oscillations may aid learning by stimulating certain connections in the brain again and again; would this also be related to the wakefulness of a person, and the importance of learning? As probably only important simuli need be learned.

Osler: Famous physician, stressing equianimity (or the compartment model of the mind, shutting off thoughts of future and past). Established the first 'journal club'.

Osler-principle: [#Peal175] Not trying to worry about too much at a time. “This one thing I do”

Others: [#NS180114 “When the face doesn't fit”] We have a kind of 'humanness' gauge that has a lower setting for people of another gender, another religion, handicapped people etc. Narcissists and people aware of an elevated social or professional status (like doctors) tend to devalue the humanity of others more strongly [in doctors, may be linked to better outcomes due to prescribing painful but effective treatments]. Dehumanizing = denying ability of others to be rational or thoughtful. Less activation of 'theory of mind' when we look at face which we think belongs to an outside group. People remember faces of group members better. Bias reversed when heard they were accidentally assigned to wrong group. Dehumanizing tendencies can be reduced by encouraging interactions between groups or pointing out the groups belong to the same umbrella group. [but then, people outside that are dehumanized even more!]. When reminded of rejecting someone, people rate themselves as less open-minded, rational and self-restrained; according themselves less humanity.

Out-of-sight, out-of-mind-principle: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/201109/personal-growth-why-inspirational-talks-dont-work/comments] For example, in one study on exercise adherence (Brownell, Stunkard, & Albaum, 1980), cartoon posters designed to encourage taking the stairs were placed near elevators in a public building. Stair climbing increased from 6% to 14% in just one month. Then, when the posters were removed, stair climbing returned to 6% (or baseline) three months later.

Outline: [#EricB393] Preparing an outline can increase writing productivity.

Outsider: [#SciAmMindnovdec09] Katherine W. Phillips shows that bringing an outsider into a group who agrees with some, but not with all members produces more thinking and better results.

Outsourcing: [#Int070912] The success of outsourcing is partially cultural: in the Netherlands, call center work is considered boring; in the Philippines, an entire family saves for an English course for their daughter, and the daughter will also try to sell something to the customer as well. Social support + job for the bright and ambitious.

Overdistanding/underdistancing: [#Zill260] Overdistancing (boredom!) takes place if the play/movie/characters are not seen as personally relevant, underdistancing (avoidance!) if they are seen as too relevant (lonely persons focusing on the style, not substance of a song about loneliness)

Overimitation: [#NS170514TheDomesticatedBrain(book review)] Chimps will only imitate the actions necessary to reach a goal, children will imitate all actions, as fitting in is seen as more important than reaching a goal.

Overinclusiveness: [#Eyse8] The tendency to not limit ones associations to relevant ideas {my own Gullit lecture?} May be important for both schizophrenia and creativity. {And following a conversation when there are multiple persons speaking?}

Overjustification effect: [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/everybody-is-stupid-except-you/201110/living-the-game-fans-in-love-players-work] The effect that if we get rewarded (a lot) for something, our intrinsic motivation to do it decreases. Effect seems stronger if payment does not depend on performance. Does not work with unexpected rewards, and with nonmaterial rewards, such as praise.

Overlearning: [#Hatt30] A term for reaching fluency, or something like 'unconscious competence' in a (hopefully important) field. [#Higbee63] Overlearning (=learning after perfect mastery) helps both storage strength and retrieval strength, though the difference between 100% overlearning and 50% overlearning is smaller than between 50% overlearning and 0% overlearning.

Overly energetic engineer: [RobertoCortez] Delegate them important tasks, give them opportunities to show their skills. Provide freedom to explore, assign investigation work.

Overpractice: [#GiftednessMusicPres] Can lead to midlife crisis, burnout, extinguishes curiosity, produces anxiety.

Overprotectedness: [#Howe111] Sidis' parents were overprotective, and he could yet not dress himself as an adolescent!

Oversight: [#Catmul202] The oversight group in Disney was established to prevent people messing up, but disregarded the more important problem of how to enable people to solve problems. Catmul’s rule of thumb: any time you instate limits or procedures, ask how they will aid in enabling people to respond creatively. Nitpicking every decision demoralizes the group.

Overthinking: [#Sidis] Is not dangerous, if it exists at all. Most mental problems come from worry, emotional excitement or lack of interest in the work.

Overview: Usually used in education and presentations, an overview serves several functions. First of all it makes clear what will be discussed and not be discussed, so as not to make the impression that the lesson/speech will last forever (in education, it's also known as the “spoorboekje”). A second function is to show how the various parts are related, but perhaps the most important function is to make clear how the speech ties in with the listener's knowledge and interests – following a speech and not knowing that it can help you become a more successful speaker is harder than if you give the audience a reason to listen to your speech, and that you WILL get to your point eventually.It may help link the new knowledge to the right category of existing knowledge.

Overwhelm: [#More/EW] By trying to do something too fast/too good/too complex you may overwhelm yourself. This can lead to stress and falling back into automatisms.

Overwhelming yourself: [#Burn89] Either feeling that you need to do the large task all at once, or thinking about all the other things you should be doing now too!

Own thing: [#http://www.intermediair.nl/weekblad/20140306/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2014wk10&utm_campaign=iw&e=1#4] In a health organisation, people knew a lot, but there was no communication, everyone did 'his own thing' and there were no systematic processes and protocols.

Ownership: [#Whit43] Ownership of a goal means that you either determine what you do, or (if that is not possible) how and when you do it. Sometimes you can coach certain goals or rules out of people, and discuss the difference with the official goal.

Oxytocin: [#Bron145] Teens have higher amounts of oxytocin receptors, which makes them more sensitive to peer pressure. [#NS180611] Oxytocin also increases hypnotizability. [#NS120211] watching a story with emotions increases oxytocin levels/increase of bonding with protagonist? [#NS'Dark side of love'] After a sniff of oxytocin, people donate more money to charity, become better at reading emotions on other people's faces [but only if they were bad at that in the first place], communicate more constructively during arguments and perceive others to be more triustworthy, attractive and approachable. Reduces trust though in those who are especially anxious or sensitive to rejection. [#NS191111] Having the GG-version of an oxytocin receptor makes others judge you as kinder, since they uesed significantly more non-verbal empathetic gestures in their storytelling, such as smiling and nodding. [#NS121013 “Reflections on the Musical Mind”] Listening to music releases oxytocin; people with William's syndrome both have high levels of circulating oxytocin and a strong love of music. [#HaidtH197] Creates feelings of love, calmness and desire for contact. [#NS300917CreatureComforts] Stroking a pet raises circulating levels of oxytocin in both participants.

Pace: [#Glad262] A slower pace in teaching (math, for example) may help children who are not the quickest not be left behind. Besides, the extra hours at KIPP give the teachers more time to be relaxed, explain extra things and stuff.

Pacing: [#Clar102] Letting learners set the pacing increases learning (by reducing unnecessary cognitive load) [#Clar119] Keeping a brisk pace but ensuring that all people make continuous progress is best. Asking “Are there any questions” seldom works well- instead, pause for exercise or small discussion to apply the new knowledge.

Pacquaio: [#Greene121] Seemed never to tire of training or worry about overdoing it [EW: can be dangerous, there is risk of injury..]

PAD temperament model: [#Mehr145] The PAD model describes positive versus negative states, dominance-submissiveness is a measure of control, A of magnitude and duration of arousal in response to high-information (complex/changing/novel) stimuli.

Pain: [#Greene212] Pain may be a kind of opinion the body gives on its own health. [#NS170115PainReallyCanBeAllInYourMind] People put in bad moods have a lower tolerance for pain, and depression and anxiety are linked to pain conditions. If you think of some pain (like heat) as a warm blanket on a cool day, parts of the nucleus accumbens and the ventromedial cortex get activated, altering the pain you feel (even though the rest of the brain showed as much 'pain activity' as before). So possibly cognitice therapies and neurofeedback may help . [#HayesS16] Pain of presence vs pain of absence, avoiding pain of presence leads to pain of absence (missing things). Danger: living one’s life on what one feels instead of what one does.

Painting: [#Root] Painting and drawing seem very well correlated to impact ratio. [#RoadToEx27] Many artists are drawn to painting due to a desire for social isolation.

Pair Learning: [#Nati124] For learning a second language, pair learning can sometimes be superior to regular class learning, as there is more frequent feedback and learners use simpler definitions

PAO system: [#Foer165] Remembering a person, action and object for every number from 00 to 99, so a six-digit number can be remembered as one image. Also works for cards etc.

Paracelsus: [#Jaff16] Paracelsus was critical, inflammable, non-conformist and insulting. {P? Nof agreeable?} Father was a doctor. Mentor Johannes Trithemius. Stayed a while at every famous university in Europe, even studied Moorish medicine in Montpellier, visited Constantinople, Egypt, Turkestan. Mixed with gypsies, magicians, quacks, warlocks and robbers. Learned what worked and what was false, and developed a hatred for the false medicine, and a missionary's zeal to fight it. May have been narcissistic or manic, definitely had a very high opinion of his own abilities, saw himself as chosen by God. Also taught in German. Inflammable, even insulted the judges. Father was famous physician, Paracelsus himself however a very sickly child. Hated injustice and fake science. Had lack of money and plenty of setbacks after Basel, but had the fire of the crusader to heal and to teach and write. Became embittered but continued his crusade. Died early though... bad health, too stressful/uncomfortable environment, or worn down by his failures?

Paradigm: [#Strien154] Old scientists were not stupid, they had another, internally consistent way of looking at the world, a 'rock in movement' being different from a rock 'in its natural place'. Facts were placed in a theory, a way of looking at things, people see what they expect to see. [#EW] Would paying attention to more aspects ('Wengering') help break a paradigm? Or trying to think of different interpretations? [#161] Paradigm switches most easily absorbed by young researchers or those coming from another field; apparently being socialized in a field for too long makes the ideas too strong to ignore -possibly also because they have beforehand 'rejected' anomalous pieces.

Paradigm shift: [#Strien156] In reality, paradigm shifts need several if not many scientists over multiple generations to take place. [#Jaffe134] The paradigm shift allowed by Avogadro's molecules allowed chemists to see old data in a new light, resolve contradictions, see things more clearly.

Paradigms: [#Strien167] Scientists who don't share values and beliefs of their group can be cast out.

Parasites: [#NS300515InvasionOfTheMindSnatchers] Male rats with toxoplasmosis have higher testosterone levels; they both spend more time and effort seeking out breeding opportunities, get sexually aroused by the smell of cat urine take more risks to get sex, and are found more attractive by female rats. Note that human males with toxoplasmosis have uncommonly high testosterone levels and are viewed as particularly masculine and dominant by women. May also cause schizophrenia and definitely causes slower reaction times and traffic accidents. Infected men are more likely to disregard rules and be excessively suspicious or jealous. One possible mechanism is that the parasite has genes for tyrosine hydroxylase, which  increases dopamine levels in the brain. @Flu viruses (as in vaccination) may also make people more sociable in the first 48 hours after infection.

Parental age: [#NS240617OlderDadsGeekierSons] Older fathers have been linked to autism and schizophrenia, their sons are more likely to have a high IQ, being less concerned about fitting in, and able ton focus deeply on subjects of interest.

Parental loss: [#Eyse132] Parental loss results in higher need for power, as well as for higher incidence for psychoticism (though psychotic parents also die younger; it may be that P-genes are more strongly activated by loss, however). Criminals and suicidal depressives show similar parental loss figures. {so parental loss not necessarily conductive to success} [#Ster121] Artists tend to come from less auspicous settings than scientists {EW: higher P?}. [#Hargit106] Donald Cram, Sune Bergstrom, Elias Corey lost their father when young.

Parental pressures: [#Int281011] Parental pressure is a better predictor of future income than IQ. (study from Boston)

Parenting: [#Coyl217] Pay attention to what your children are fascinated by, and praise them for their effort. [#Pino] Always choose the side of your child, even if he/she may be wrong. [#Nett215] Parenting style does not seem to have any measureable effect on the personality of their children. [#Strien280] More creative scientists indicate that they have been raised 'not very authoritarianatively' – tended to come from individualistic, non-conformistic, democratically oriented families. Also may have been affected by a combination of special attention and overprotection and having high demands. For female scientists, the support of their father to develop themselves independently was most important. [#NS120817] Puppies that receive most maternal care tend to lack self-conreol and problem-solving ability of a successful guide dog, possibly because overmothered pups are not sufficiently challenged early in life.

Parents: [#Bloo141] Parents who find studying, responsibility and self-discipline important and value success, produce children who have an easier time achieving goals. Interesting, a majority of the parents of the swimmers valued these things by mouth, but didn't seem to actually have a high drive to do better at work. {mey be frustrated at work, no advancement possible?} May not notice a child's interest in arts if they themselves are interested mainly in sports, even though it may not stop the child from becoming an artist eventually {EW: but a top artist?}. Parents emphasized status more than money. Did not forbid changing one's mind, but stressed that one should not 'run', quit because one is not doing too well at the moment, but just keep at it for a little time longer. [#Bloo454] Parents either sat at lessons, or had very regular discussions with the instructor and anyway did their best (with books, magazines etc.) to keep informed on the field so they could supervise and guide their children better. [#EricB693] The best young soccer players (in contrast to average players) rated one of their parents as the most influential person in their career. [#Ster435] Parents of later successful pianists were more often exchanging information with the teacher, and gave the child more help and encouragement when practicing. [#Hatt33] Important is that parents have high expectations and aspirations for the child, AND that parents speak the 'language of schooling'. [#Hatt64] Children who have two parents do slightly better at school than one-parent children, though the effect is greatly reduced by good financial provisions for single-parent households. Having a father boosts achievement a bit (0.26). Divorce or the death of one parent have slight negative effects (-0.22). Only-borns, first-borns and children from small families (2) score highest, and in psychology are more positive than all other children. Maternal employment does not matter. Maternal involvement, variety and play materials matter. Parental aspirations have a positive effect, parental supervision (monitoring student's homework, watching television, time going out with friends) have a negative effect. Well, homework supervision seems to have a small positive effect on achievement, though negative on motivation [or not?] homework surveillance, external rewards, negative control, and restrictions for unsatisfactory grades. Good is to give the students control over their own studies. Tutoring is helpful, home visits by and interaction with teachers too. [#Redirect82] An intrusive, controlling parenting style (at least, as seen by their children) is associated with low autonomy in children and low overall well-being. [#Greene26] Your parents may try to push your career into a path that is lucrative and comfortable. [#Weiner199] Hatred of one parent is good for artists? “Protective love of both parents can destroy an artist” [#When the past comes back to haunt you: The enduring influence of upbringing on the work–family decisions of professional parents-IoanaLupu] Men raised in traditional households (father breadwinner) don’t feel guilt over putting career ahead of family, and women raised try to focus on work-life balance. So rather than rational choices based on current circumstances, people tend to reproduce the relationship of their parents, unless there are really special circumstances.

Pareto Principle: [#Ferr70] 80% of income comes from 20% of activities. Which activities can you scrap without major losses, and which are promising candidates for extension?

Parietal lobes: [#NS060413] Involved in integrating sensory information and attention {EW: and binding? Creativity?}

Parkinson's law: [#Ferr75] The more time you have for something, the more time it takes. Use Parkinson's law and the Pareto Principle to your advantage. (very) short and clear deadlines work best.

Parks, Gordon: [#Robi56] American photographer, mother died at 15, kept knocking at all doors, looking for every possible stimulus, did everything to get a career in photography. A constant exertion, a feeling that he should not fail. He continued to try to improve himself as a photographer.

Part-whole training: [#EricB279] Training parts of a task (especially complex parts) first may lead to higher achievement later than just training the whole task. Example: space invaders. But complex parts first may not be good if that task is not mastered.

Partial reinforcement: [#Kluw276] Partial reinforcement needs as many reinforcements as full reinforcements (yet, of course, more trials). Is better explained by computational learning theories than associative learning theories.

Passions: [#Dwec] May be more important than resume {and presence of growth mindset may also work, I suppose. Passion should be for work, rather than ego.} [#Robi178] There's a big difference between a mere 'interest' and a passion. [#Syed125] “Every endeavour pursued with passion produces a successful outcome regardless of the result”. [#White76] Showing one's passion for something is usually very good, 'having your heart on your tongue'. Especially since people who need to choose find choice difficult and time-consuming, and any enthousiasm and initiative from you is welcome. [#Newportxxi] Perhaps it is not as important to find the right work as it is to work right. [#Newport13] Even passionate people have lots of different interests. “You can never be sure – you don't want to be sure”. [#Newport14] About 84% of students reports having a passion, but 96% of those passions don't have any obvious career implication (most are reading or dancing etc.) [#17] Strongest predictor of seeing work as calling is number of years spent on the job. [#38] Entering the workforce with the passion mindset leaves you vulnerable to the many frustrations with bureaucracy and such to come. [#Int261012] Passion (Arnold Bakker) is a combination of dedication (feeling challenged), vitality and flow/absorption. [#Jansen21] You may want to list the things that empassioned you when you were young, and those things that empassion you now. [#EW/FrankNoom290814] Mensen zoeken hun passie omdat ze zoeken naar betekenis: waarom ben ik hier op aarde? Maar is misschien gewoon een symptoom van als ze niet voldoende plezier krijgen uit hun werk, in de vorm van goede relaties met mensen, feedback, mastery, autonomie… [#Weiner154] David Hume: “Let reason be the slave of your passion.” [#Catmul300] Steve Jobs respected passions of people [EW: possibly he understood that blocking passions won’t give you the best work/pour their heart into it] – though he also gave reason/logic/facts equal weight.

Passive haptic learning: [#NS210614LearnBrailleThroughGoodVibrations] Giving vibrations to knuckles while hearing audio cues increase braille retetnion rate to 70% (from 22%). Look up?

Pasteur, Louis: [#wiki] Invented pasteurization, created first rabies and anthrax vaccines, discovered molecular basis for asymmetrical crystals, helped solidify germ theory, discovered causes of fermentation, and also discovered that some organisms could live without oxygen. Average student, but excelled in drawing and painting. Deaths of his children inspired him to find cures for diseases. [#Strien262] Filled a 'hole' in the hygiene movement, but had a sense for show, drama and rhetorics, and had also the motto that luck favoured the brave – made quite some gambles, which worked out.

Pasteur’s quadrant: [#Schmid217] whether research does or does not advance basic understanding, and whether it does or does not solve real-world problems. Theory is that most innovation happens in the abu+rwp corner. Most companies get in the quadrant where neither science nor goals are interesting.

Path vs principles: [#EW/Carl111116] Often people want to have a path (what to do next to find one’s dream job), while another approach is to keep general principles in mind and work with those.

Patience: [#AlexanderGatting] Children often imitate their parents in learning long-term over short-term consequences; so patient parents tend to produce patient children. Having strict parents also raises patience. Intense education (spending much time with the children) also enhances patience. Patient people smoke and drink less, sport more and more often follow lectures (if they're students). Note though that situation still has greater influence than 'natural' patience.

Pattern forming: [#Root03] Fifth of 13 thinking tools, pattern forming is to take elements and operations and combine them in novel ways (in art, {fractals are repetitive} or when designing machines}

Pattern recognition: [#Root03] The third thinking tool; perceiving a form or plan in an apparently random set of things. Pattern recognition is influenced by culture: western people are much better at finding linear patterns than spiral patterns. [#Eric14] Experts recognize the deeper meaning of a pattern, a novice just the surface characteristics.

Pattern-based retrieval: [#Eric14] Chess experts don't search more deeply than novices, they have a larger database of patterns to select from.

Pauli, Wolfgang: [#Crop256] Pauli was a very good critic: great understanding, high intellectual honesty, very perceptive in not letting a slipshod argument pass. And willingness to step on people's intellectual corns {EW: bit of intellectual bully?} Physically round and clumsy, but intellectually brilliant. Father was professor in physical chemistry, mother newspaper correspondent. Godfather Ernst Mach, strong presence. Pauli was only son. Prodigy in all subjects, read Einstein's paper in high school and published papers on general relativity himself. Started his career as a research student under Arnold Sommerfeld at Munich. Then assistant to Max Born, in a big physics institute, then to Bohr in Copenhagen. Then Hamburg (first professorship), then ETH. Had a great mind, but could be too critical, seeing to many problems, and not liking to make imaginative jumps. {EW: the 'Pauli Principle', that things failed while Pauli was around – perhaps because his constant criticism made other people nervous and/or pay attention to him, the threat, instead of the job? Second, his own unproductivity in later life, and stopping his student from publishing on spin – kind of fixed mindset, afraid of failing himself? And that that stopped him from being creative/daring/playful like his competitors?}

Pauling, Linus: [#Hargit54] Linus Pauling was more successful than his colleague Astbury because he knew and incorporated quantum mechanics in his models, also a lot of factual information. Pauling was actually quite meticulous, also due to the help of his associate Corey. Could be vain, though, attacked someone for thinking of a test for the alfa-helix before he did. [#Hargit93] Was able to discover the alfa-helix since he knew maths well, and his enormous knowledge of structural chemistry allowed him which pieces of information to use, and which to ignore. [#Hargit147] Had good collaboration with Robert Corey, even though their personalities were opposite: Pauling seeking the limelight, Corey nitpicking. [#Hargit218] Ignored pleas of European Jewish crystallographers to help them out; they died in death camps. This haunted Pauling for decades.

Pausch, Randy: [#Pausch] Engineering is not about perfect solutions, it's doing the best you can do with limited resources. Pausch was a workaholic (according to his wife) {EW: could be very motivated for a task and concentrate on it for a long time, probably found it very important}. Was a visual thinker, assembled 300 slides with pictures. Did sabbatical at Electronic Arts, became close as brothers with an executive there (so good in making friends; always had fun}. We cannot change the cards we're dealt, we can just play the hand. Mother was teacher, high expectations of children. Parents were very frugal. Family thought about everything, very inquisitive father. Parents always found way ways off the beaten path, possibilities to help people ((O, A). Pausch had lots of imagination himself. Parents mostly condoned that. There's often a brick wall, but there are always loopholes (becoming the reporter for the space flight; have something to offer the other, though, like in this case publicity). Coach: practice without ball first, since that's what the other 20 guys are doing. Fundamentals. If nobody gives you any criticism, they have given up on you {EW: though some critics may be jealous, nasty or perfectionistic} You can't give children self-esteem, it's something they need to build. Family worshiped the World Book Encyclopedia. Parents never bought anything for impressing other people. Pausch won most of his stuffed animals without family members looking, because of less pressure and because it's less inspiring if people know how hard you worked at it. “The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how much we want something” {optimistic interpretation; they're designed to prevent errors and lots of good things as well}. Pausch was always very persistent, for example on getting the lead imagineer on the phone to ask questions about their new attraction. Came 'accidentally' to California, doing 80 hours of homework in advance calling all VR experts he knew to share their thoughts and questions about the Disney project, and at lunch 'made the ask'. Was fortunate to have a dutch uncle, who gave him caring feedback that he could come across as arrogant and tactless and that that was going to limit what he'd be able to reach in his life. People who can recalibrate you can be very valuable. Cares about utility, not status, and does not want to repair dented car as long as it still drives. Time must be carefully managed, like money. Don't spend time on irrelevant details. “It doesn't matter how well you polish the underside of the banister”. You can always change your plan, but only if you have a plan in the first place. Trick: break things up in small steps, like asking his son just to pick up one item. Are you spending time on the right things? Develop a good filing system [Pausch was obviously someone who was motivated to produce a lot and thought deeply about that!] Use speaker phone, so your hands are free to do something else while you're put on hold. Next to that, stand up while speaking and have something on your desk you want to do. Educators may best serve students by helping them to become more self-reflective. But getting people to welcome feedback is extremely hard, also as an educator. Want people on his team who are not only smart, but who make other people happy to be there. Luck is where preparation meets opportunity (learning nothing until you see an opening is not that good of an idea). “Guys, that was pretty good, but I know you can do better” (and picked brain of his mentor to get that). The closer people are in a group (physically, indicating bonding), the better the ideas. [p124] Takes earnest over hip person any time. Made a deal with mother to replace dining room furniture if things ever got broken, to prevent arguments over leaning back in his chair. If you'd spend the energy and time complaining to solving the problem you're much better off [EW: or time spent avoiding the problem]. Treat the disease, not the symptom. Don't worry too much about what other people think. Meeting people: ensure optimal meeting conditions, like food. Try find commonalities, like sports. And give suggestions like “What if we'd do A, not B?” instead of “ I think we should do A”. Experience is what you get if you didn't get what you wanted. Instated 'first pinguin'-award for team that took biggest technological risk without achieving their stated goals. Also was good showman: bashed VCR in class for user interface design. Hand-written thank-you notes work. Before he had a family worked very hard (call be on Friday night at 10 o clock in office). Treated colleagues to trip to Disney world on obtaining tenure, but was also sure to stop by other computer scientists on the way. (Show gratitude) Bad apologies worse than no apology. Proper: what I did was wrong, I feel badly that I hurt you, how can I make this better? Small investments in relationships can yield big returns, like replacing the $10 pepper and salt-shaker even while it was not Disney's fault 'indebted' Pausch mentally to spend over $100,000 dollars in trips later. No job is beneath you. People will ask (openly or closely) “What can you do for us?”. Find out a way to help them (like saving 20s per guest on a ride) Called admissions office of Brown University until they put him from the wait list to the accepted list. Van Dam advised him to become a professor as Randy was such a good salesman, might as well sell something worthwhile like education. [but Pausch was not a great student, possibly because of his extraversion]. Gave students a paper outlining their rights and responsibilities for this class (like receive grades on time, but to work constructively in groups and to give honest feedback). Be a communitarian (dad asked older kids to umpire for baseball, giving the younger kids good role models. Sometimes all you need to do is ask (whether you can be at the front seat of a ride, for example}. Asked if he could talk for 30 minutes to Fred Brooks, once of the most famous computer scientists alive. Got 90 minutes and a life-long mentor. It's hard to recharge in the presence of small children (because no control, too many impulses?)

Pause point: [#NS200210] Gawande: have pause points, like pilots do, to check what you're doing

Pause-and-plan-response: [#McGon35] Inverse of FFF response, response to internal conflict.

Pay: [#PinkDrive172] A high level of base pay works better than big bonuses for motivation; it also reduces turnover and can therefore be cheaper than the alternative.

Payment-directed: [#EW] One problem with companies like IntelliMagic is that nobody is paying them to provide good Uis, to clean their code, or to enhance their expertise in their field. So they're not doing it.

PDP: [#Ster354] Parallel Distributed Processing, a computer model that mimics lots of human characteristics, such as pattern recognition even in the presence of noise. {EW: could we use that to make a sort of human-learning computer, much faster than a human could?}

Peace of mind: [#Pealviii] Peace of mind can be a power center for effective living. Getting peace of mind can be aided by trying to say optimistic, peaceful things in conversation. [#InPraiseOfShadows_Tanizaki] Does being surrounded by old objects give peace/repose?

Pedagogy: [#NS201110] Natural pedagogy may have developed in response to the advent of toolmaking, techniques becoming so opaque that it was too inefficient or impossible to learn from observation only.

Peer pressure: [#Switch227] 'Peer pressure' may not be as important as 'peer perception', imitating what you see others do. [#Redirect137] May also be at work in the crime increasing 'scared straight' studies. [#143] Though teens in groups also try to impress one another, not always with desirable results.

Peer reports: [#Mehr157] Peer reports tend to have greater validity than self-reports – people apparently either do not know themselves very well or try to hide their flaws.

Peer tutoring: [#Meie16] Peer tutoring seems four times more effective in raising performance than reduced class size or lengthened instruction time. [#Hatt187] Peer tutoring improves the performance of both tutors and tutees, and is most effective when cross-age, instead of same-age, or adult-student. Also most effective when supplement of regular teaching. Though can be more effective than regular instruction, especially for disabled students! More effective in acquisition phase than in proficiency phase, and more effective when there are clear learning goals. Works even better if tutoring is student-controlled (students involved in setting goals, monitoring performance, evaluating performance, and selecting rewards)

Peers: [#Ster176] Often peers were found to be important in helping a creator redefine a field. [#Csik128] The craving to being accepted by peers may be harmful for talent development, especially if those peers are 'normal' people. [#Hatt2] Peers can be excellent co-teachers in classrooms, but are enormously under-used.

People: [#Redirect54] Other people can be a source of comfort/reduce anxiety when we're stressed; this even goes for strangers! [#Hargit130] James Watson's rules: avoid dumb people, and always turn to people who are brighter than yourself. Gajdusek: birght people hang out with other bright people. [#Stalla198] In the longest-living organisations, managers paid more attention to people than on assets; to the team and keeping the team together than keeping the product line consistent ( and leave their companies in as good or better shape than when they started.)

People bias: [#Feist55] Infants are biased towards looking at faces instead of objects, and particularly at attractive faces.

Perceptions: [#Colv86] Tennis players automatically train themselves to predict where the serve will be hit by learning to watch the opponent's hips and shoulders. Essentially, they extract more relevant information from the environment. [#Weng56] It is usually more productive, when stuck, to list all you perceive about a problem than everything you know about it. [#Ster42] Heightened perception is also a characteristic of creative people. [#CIA2] Perception is an active process, which constructs rather than observes reality, based on what you know. We tend to perceive what we expect to perceive ? so it takes more, and more unambiguous information to perceive an unexpected phenomenon than an expected one. [#Syed207] Through top-down processing, experts perceive the world differently; in our own language we hear pauses were actually none exist, our brains chunk the information into meaningful units, which fail for (for example) foreign languages. [#NRC290512] If you're hungry, mountains look steeper. [#Sommers18] We perceive others much as we perceive our favourite sitcom characters, who act much the same from episode to episode. (note: the 'characters' in reality TV are often the result of creative editing or staging) [#NS180114TheIpodInMyHeadThatNeverStops] Not all information is passed from lower brain regions for sensory perception to higher brain regions; the higher brain guesses what is coming, and only processes further signals if the prediction is wrong [#MS290417SeeingIsNotPerceiving] Perceptions are the result of what we have experienced and the meanings attributed to those experiences, so you can change your future perceptions by using imagination to rewire those associated meanings. [#HaidtH66] We are fairly accurate in our perceptions of others. But we do see ourselves through very rose-colored glasses. Note that we tend to behave how we think others would behave (though possibly a bit worse). Note that part is because of ambiguity: people are better at overestimating their leadership ability than their juggling ability. And people who have pervasive positive illusions about themselves, their abilities and future prospects are mentally healthier, happier and more well-liked than people who lack such illusions.

Perceptual blocks: [#Adams13] Obstacles that prevent the problem-solver from clearly perceiving either the problem itself or the information needed to solve the problem. [EW: exhaustive writing of Wenger?]. Examples: stereotyping.Good for completing incomplete data [and saving thinking time], but we are less able to notice unique characteristics of another person or thing. Stereotyped conceptions of parts may hinder their integration into a new whole (brick = building). Sterotypes almost naturally a result of that we can't store every characteristic of an object in memory – we recall the sterrotyped. Stereotyping seems much more prevalent for material that is unimportant or unpleasant for you. Problems are often obscured by inadequate cues or misleading information [EW: or irrelevant/unrelated information]. [#24] Can also occur because we delimit the problem area too closely (nine-dot puzzle) [who says the surface must remain intact?]. Or inability to see the problem from different viewpoints. 5: saturation, you don't remember things because you don't need to remember them (the number configuration on your phone). Also hard if real data occurs only sparsely, interrupted with oodles of irrelevant data. Using more senses can also help.

Perceptual contrast effect: [#Gold156] A 5 kg weight looks lighter after lifting 10 kg, and a message with 3 points looks more convincing after one has read a competing message with 1 point instead of 6 points. Does not have to be relevant competing information (car versus wine).

Perfect first draft: [#EricB393] Writers who try to start with a perfect first draft are about as productive as those who start writing with a rough draft {EW: read reference? And test out for yourself?}

Perfectionism: [#Mill44] Perfectionism combined with lack of self-confidence led to the remarkably low productivity of Mr. Austin. [#Simo/EW] Quality in geniuses is very much correlated to quantity; a genius cannot make one superior master-work, even with infinite time and effort. [#Pers121] Perfectionists remember their own errors extremely well, and are therefore often full of self-doubt, which is a disadvantage in for example competitive sports. Can lead to depression if high goals are not achieved. Perfectionism is only advantageous if your self-esteem doesn't depend on doing well or winning (you like yourself anyway). [#Burn90] Perfectionism also enhances procrastination. Fourth of seven depression sensitivity dimensions; how well do you accept your own errors and flaws, how much can you enjoy successes? Experiment: try aim for 80%, 60%, 40% sometimes... Also investigate the fear behind your perfectionism. [#Newport31] Perfectionism, in the sense of wanting to play a chord just right, may be important to the success of a musician; though I guess there is a balance; without any perfectionism, there cannot be skill growth; with undue perfectionism, attention is focused on less-important things or laws of diminishing returns take effect.

Performance: [#EricB156] Initial performance is usually determined by general cognitive traits, such as intelligence. Expert performance is often determined by other traits, such as speed of perception and response coordination for driving. [#StolB10] Performance is behaviour+accomplishment. [#StolB27] Always try to ask questions of fact, not opinion if you want to improve performance. [#StolB53] First identify your (business) goals, then the desired behaviours, only THEN try to design interventions. Compare desired to actual behaviours. Determine magnitude (global/local), value and urgency.[#Whit79] Performance, learning and enjoyment form a triangle, and you can't make one better long term when neglecting the other two. [#Gosl20] Performance is related to an optimum level of arousal, which can differ per individual. [#RoadToExcel] Part of the improvement in performance (looking over history) is better teaching methods/organisation of material, but part is simply higher specialisation; a 18-th century musician was also expected to be able to sight-read, compose, play different instruments, and teach. [#RoadToExcel35] In most jobs, the 'performance' limit of most practitioners is not innate, and can be lifted with (for example) external incentives. [#Int070912-BiancaGroen] Rewards like increases in salary, promotion and bonuses don't make employees perform better. Concrete agreements between supervisors and employees about desired performance does lead to better work, however. Having a say about the demand of their work motivates employees, also the agreement process leads to more discussions and compliments, which increases performance. Managers are happy since they know what their subordinates are doing, making it easier for them to influence their activities. [#Leidraad -Naomi Ellers] People work harder if they can identify themselves with their group or organisation – more important than money and better career opportunities.

Performance goal: [#Whit42] End goals are seldom in one's control, performance goals are, and are therefore much more motivating. [http://faculty.washington.edu/janegf/goalsetting.html] Intriguing findings have been obtained by Harackiewicz, Barron, Carter, Lehto, and Elliott (1997) with college students. Performance goals improved grades but did not affect interest, whereas learning goals enhanced interest in the class but did not affect grades

Performance test: [#Stol147] Testing a procedural skill by letting the learner demonstrate it in as real a situation as is safe, practical and achievable. Can't be used on covert performance (like a mental calculation), for that you'd need oral/written examinations with checklists. Verification of performance tests can be done with behaviour checklists, perhaps quantitative (how well of every behavior), frequency (how often every behaviour), or effectiveness (is the goal achieved). In any case reserve space for extra observations and comments. [#More44] Performance depends on complexity of a module, as well as its speed and its quality/perfection. Decreasing the requirements of one will increase your performance on the other points. Ideally, keep perfection, but lower complexity or speed.

Performance-based: In learning, performance-based means that you have a goal with your learning: namely that people will do something correctly or better at the end of the session. Each learning session should have a goal, and if that goal is not reached, the learning failed, notwithstanding that it is perfectly possible that the session has been fun.

Periodic meetings: [#Schmid193] Google has a format for “1:1”s -both manager and managee produce list of 5 most important points to discuss/problems to solve.

Peripersonal space: [[#NS090716WeCanSenseOurInvisibleForceField] We also have a sense of 'perimerpsonal space', trying to avoid objects from getting into it (like branches). So some neurons fire if an object comes into peripersonal space.

Periphery: [#Newport64] Alex Berger quit his job at the National Lampoon, which was in the periphery of what he wanted to do (screenwriting) and went for a job at the heart of the industry, NBC, so he could learn what it would take to succeed.

Permanence: [#Pers254] Permanence is the assumption that everything that happens has a huge impact on the rest of your life. Together with pervasiveness it will result in a “hopeless/helpless” personality.

Permission: [#Ferr33] Getting forgiveness is much easier than getting permission – prefer that if damage you'd do wouldn't devastate others and can be reversed. [#GijsScholtenVanAsschat] Permission/freedom enhances fun (and hence) creativity, duty stifles.

Perseverance: [#Howe140] Perseverance is a characteristic of most geniuses, Einstein struggled for three weeks with proving Pythagoras' theorem, yet did not give up. [#Jansen28] Perseverance can be valuable in getting a paper published or solving a problem [EW: however – don't persevere too much; the problem may be impossible, and the paper may have been bad; let your intuition rather than your ego be your guide]. Note that you may need alternative strategies, like talking to others or putting the problem aside for some time. [#Packer21] Gingrich also tried again and again to get in congress, never giving up, even in more than 8 years.

Persistence: [#Ster27] Next to intellectual qualities, very high persistence 'of motive and effort' was one of three personality characteristics Cox found. [#Pers42] Most successful in Terman's test compared to least successful had more persistence and self-confidence/freedom from inferiority feelings. [#Bron24] Persistence can be trained by intermittent rewards, there is a special circuit that is activated more in some people than in others, telling you to not give up that easily, there is a reward over the horizon. [#Hargit86] Kroto did not stay long enough with the C-P phosphorus bonds to strengthen his name in that subfield, so he stayed longer for the fullerenes.

Person-activation: [#Nass5] The 'click-whirr' that can make someone treat a computer or sock puppet as a person (?perhaps even tree spirit explanation) even though that is rationally laughable. We 'overpersonalize'. This has also the effect that people started to hate Clippy, he never learned their names and preferences. (so if you usually forget names, you're the human equivalent of Clippy). [#8] Ctechnologies become more likable by behaving the way people are supposed to behave.

Personal interest: [#Clar370] Personal interest can be leveraged in class by letting students share a certain situation in which they had a problem. Personal interest can compensate for a lack of situational interest (and vice versa); you mainly need to make materials 'interesing' in the audience is not intrinsically interested.

Personal worth: [#Burn341] Personal worth is an abstraction that doesn't really exist, much like “your true self”. What problems you face in life, and how you deal with them, that's where the action is. Philosophizing over worth is ridiculous. Rather aim for satisfaction, pleasure, learning, mastery, personal growth and communication with others.

Personalisation: [#Gold44] Handwritten post-it notes on surveys make it more likely the surveys are returned. The more effort you appear to have done, the more it is reciprocated. Getting to know each other's backgrounds will also increase the likeliness of good negotiating outcomes. [#http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm] Try to link data to your own experience {EW: 'Credible'?} may help you remember and diminish interference. [#SellHuman211] Adding a photograph of the patient uncovers many more accidental findings.

Personality attributes: [#Csik75] Talented teenagers are more likely than their peers to be curious, actively receptive to the world around them, have a greater desire to excel and a greater ability to persevere, have greater dominance and exhibition, lower self-doubt (abasement). Males dislike change a bit more, as well as greater harm avoidance; and a greater need for social recognition.

Personalization principle: [#Clar178] People learn better {?pay more attention?} when materials are presented in conversational style rather than formal style, possibly since we have evolved to pay attention to other people. Using “you” and “I” helps!

Personalizing: [#Pers254] Personalizing is blaming/praising yourself for what happens to you.

Perspective: [#EW] It matters a great deal whether you see drawing as an obligatory school subject or as a way to learn how to observe more closely. If you want to shift your perspective from “what will people think of me” to “how can I explain this most clearly”, first think in the new perspective in non-stressful situations, it will come easier when you actually talk then. [#EricB26] Experts are much worse at predicting how easy a task is for novices. Students profited more from the comments by their peers on a paper than by comments from an expert. Experts are worse at taking a novice's perspective. [#EW] Teacher attitude may also influence perspective, of course “You must learn for the exams!” [#Weng143] At least in imagination, it can help to try perceive sound, smell, sight, and try to shrink inside the apparatus, different times of day/year, as a member of another species/race/whatever? [#EW120713] Talking with Hermen, it was clear that I was too close to see the obvious: googling where competing books were published.

Persuasion: [#NS] Successful persuasion also depends on the reputation of the person doing the persuading. [#Influence14] Expert manipulaors make the person believe that the circumstances made him/her choose X, not the manipulator's actions. Tools are reciprocation (people feel obliged to repay a favour in kind, even if the favour is unwanted, like the Hare Krishna flowers) [#NS191111] Tim Minchin: people want to feel good about what they think; laughter and music may both disarm foreground defenses. More susceptible to messages that come in song or make people laugh. “Difference between me and preachers is that I didn't start intending to change people's minds. I'm just saying here's a place where I'm going to talk about my ideas. Do you want to come? There'll be lights.” [#NS150912] Making corrections is hard, don't use negatives “John is not a criminal”, use visuals rather than words, or “I was shocked as well when I found out it was not true” - messages are more convincing if coming from people that share your world view. [#Nass66] Extraverts pay more for products with an 'extraverted' description, introverts more for something with an 'introverted' description (more factual, less like 'I'm sure that...') [#Nass163/191] Persuasiveness is function of expertise (labels) and trustworthiness( familiarity, reciprocity, similarity) [#Nass195] People are more likely to use the central route if the subject is very important to them, they will be held personally responsible, or have a high 'need for cognition'. Peripheral route if multitasking, stressed for time, excited, or ignorant about subject. Framing can also influence choice of route.

Perutz, Max: [#Hargit149] Was exteremely hard-working and focused on his quest to discover haemoglobin, but also was able to get lots of support from his wives and others: suggestions, samples, ideas.

Pervasiveness: [#Pers253] Pervasivess is thinking that everything that happens to you is symptom of (or has impact on) a large part of the rest of your life. Negative “pervasive” persons are called catastrophizers, not a very good strategy as they tend to die younger (and more often because of accidents or violence). Optimists are generally pervasive on the good things, and not pervasive on the bad things that happen to them. [#SellHuman106] Saying 'damn' makes a speech more persuasive {perhaps due people think that if you pay a social price, you're probably very convinced, a bit like the Christian matyrs?}

Pessimism: [#Pers154] Pessimism is advantageous for lawyers, as it encourages them to see all possible traps and pitfalls. However, at home they may need to look more cricically at the evidence or else they will tend to become unhappy themselves. In general, pessimists have a more accurate view of reality, but optimists can be more successful as they are not so easily rebuffed by failure. [#Flourish189] Pessimists underachieve on the sports field, in the classroom, and on their jobs, and have rockier relationships. [#206] Pessimists lean towards learned helplessness – so in contrast to optimists did not stop smoking when it became clear that smoking was not healthy. Also “misery loves company, but company does not love misery”

Pfeijffer: [LeidraadFall14] Writes down observations that strike him, like teenagers carrying water to a party.

Phase-locking: [#Kluw196] Neurons can synchronize their activities if a kind of 'solution' is found to a problem, or unclear input. This is called 'phase-locking' {EW: kind of resonance?}

Phases of learning: [#Bloo431] The distinct phases of learning should not be too long {EW: nor too short?}. A too-long play phase makes playing boring in the end, a too-long discipline phase withers the motivation. Optimum phase length probably depends on learner and 	teacher expertise/suitability.

PHC: [#Edu] Patrick Henry College. Religious fundamentalist college which produces surprisingly many people who get into US government.

PhD-flip: [#EW] The phenomenon that before you start your PhD, working hard is good and beneficial; but as soon as you start your PhD, laziness is more important.

Phi: [#NS090213] Giulio Toroni: phi is measure of integration between signals; if we lose consciousness, the signals in our brain don't integrate to a coherent picture anymore.

Philosophical notebook: [#EW] Asking “Why do I find this interesting” may be a useful question to ask… Also, for the ‘pshilosophical notebook projects’, especially if the do-part seems imposing or too long, writing (like blogs) instead may help motivation in the meantime.

Philosophy: [#Hargit127] Prignonine (like Einstein) also developed an interest in philosophy.

Phobias: [#NS150314 “Erase your fear...” propanolol may inhibit re-consolidation of fear memory

Phonological training: [#EricB670] Learning new words by trying to associate with rhyming words works better than orthographic training (making judgements on consonant and vowel patterns) and about as well as semantic training (trying to learn semantic associations). However, phonological and semantic training result in different brain areas for learning.

Physical activity: [#Ster141] Creative people are generally less physically active than uncreative people. [#EW] Physical activity may be required not to fall asleep in class if one is not very stimulated by the lecture. {EW so not really because people learn better when they move, but because they are more awake}

Physical attractiveness: [#Mehr154] Physical attractiveness not only correlates to the number of sexual partners, but also makes people more socially skilled/less lonely, less socially anxious, and have higher emotional stability {healthier brain, or better life?}.

Physical problems: [#EricB290] Eminent scientists (as a child) suffered more from physical problems. /more placed on their own resources.

Physical reminder: [#Gawan100] You can place a physical reminder, like a hindrance somewhere, to ensure that a checklist is executed.

Physics: [#Edu] How much students enjoy and feel confident in physics greatly determines the chance they'll choose a Nature & Technology profile.

Piaget: [#Grin] Found that children in all cultures have similar learning curves, getting progressively more advanced mental models. One cannot teach children things for which they are not 'ripe' yet {even though Terence Tao probably was much better at math at a young age than Piaget would have expected; can intensive training in a field speed things up? -apparently they can [Grin117]. Piaget greatly underestimated how much even young children can learn, though there are indeed 'critical periods' after which some things cannot or can only poorly be learned, like language after puberty} [#Hatt43] The Piagetian stage is a good predictor of how fast children can learn something, and can therefore be a useful indicator for lesson or material choice.

Pianists: [#Bloo21] Preponderance of only children, and middle-class background. Took on average 17 years to win their first international competition. Relatively many children from home of music-making parents, but even non-listening parents considered music lessons 'good for the children'. But most were exposed a lot, parents singing to them or such... Some parents were stimulated because they thought their children talented – but mostly they perceived ALL their children as talented. Most starting teachers were chosen based on proximity... But parents often sat at the first lessons to ensure the teacher and child got along. Almost always warm, maternal, “nice” person. Practiced 45 min to 90 minutes on average each day. Many parents sat next to them, to ensure that the 1 hour of practice was obeyed, or listened from another room, coming in to correct errors. All had practice books in which the teacher wrote down the practice routine for that week. Lots of praise and attention and performing for the family.Perceived specialness. Sometimes also the piano as a refuge from stress. At certain point in time, parent or teacher decided that it's better to get a better teacher. And often these daily practice routines were established when the students were very young, before they had overburdened daily schedules with friends and homework. Between 10 and 15 there usually was a kind of mental breakthrough, practice became making music.Teachers paid much more attention to details, and taught the students how to practice. Entered competitions, and profited even from losing them (realizing what they should practice more). Developed identity as pianists. Moved on to the rare and elusive master teachers (perfect and impressive role models). Teachers could be very demanding and critical, and the 'master classes' (public criticism) were especially feared. Some thought of quitting, but what else could they do? {'trapped'?}Slowly, the pianists became more independent, and sought more 'coaching', also from other musicians. ?Parents ambitious or disappointed with their own lives? Stimulated their child, but did not force him into their own vision. The more the student progresses, the more easily the parents get into the musical circles necessary to find a better teacher for their child.

Picasso, Pablo: [#Robi116] Was inspired by the african masks in an ethnographical museum to start cubism. [#Ster172] Had very strong drawing abilities even as a young child, but was academically weak.

Pictorial superiority effect (PSE): [#Medi233] The more visual an input is, the more likely it is to be recognized or recalled. We pay special attention to color, size, orientation and motion. And teachers can make their own cartoons nowadays, simple figures suffice: if drawings are too complex or lifelike, it may distract. Pictures grab attention much better than anything else.

PIFS: [#EricB626] Practical Intelligence for Schools, a program that emphasized knowing why/self/differences/process/revisiting and helped students achieve greater progress in reading, writing and testing than non-PIFS students.

Pigeon learning: [#Kluw253] Pigeons cannot learn all associations (too little brain space?) auditory cues for avoidance, visual cues for food. Auditory cues ONLY help for food if delivered immediately AFTER the peck or whatever). So brain wiring is very restricted to the natural environment. Auditory and visual neurons have no common targets in a higher-order area. Barn owls can easily associate sounds with food, however, as they feed on noisy prey.

Pilot projects: [#Int261012] Volunteer for pilot projects (if an employee). Your boss will love it, and employees who know the future of the company have more value, protection against layoff (+thank boss for feedback).

Piloting: [#Switch190] Even if an intervention is hated at first, a successful pilot that shows results can win over hearts.

Pioneering: [#Pau] When you're doing something new, expect frequent failures and ' growing pains' at first, as well as lots of arrows in the back of people who disagree or are jealous. [#EW] To be a pioneer, a very advantaged home environment is not very much needed (Stephenson, as well as the American agronomist). For mastering a ripe field however, every possible advantage counts.

Pique-technique: [#59sec216] Asking for 23 minutes of your time; odd or unusual requests.

Pitching: [#SellHuman157] Executives take passion, wit and quirkiness as positive signs, but slickness, trying too hard, or lots of ideas as negative ones. But ideas became better when the 'suits' were able to contribute. Also helped acceptance... Different pitches are the one-word-pitch, question pitch ('Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”) unless underlying arguments are weak, then question pitch has negative effect. Perhaps also reason for rethorical question (also for talent workshop): more effective processing of message content. Rhyming pitch. Subject-line pitch: utility and curiosity (utility more important if people receive lots of e-mail), twitterpitch, Pixar pitch (once upon a time...)

Placebos: [#NS150111] Placebo's may work since they shift the brain activity usually dedicated to the processing of pain to the brain parts that process emotion; making sure that pain gets 'reinterpreted'. [#NS030813] Pain relief risks further injury, and mounting an immune response is energetically expensive, so we may need an 'all-clear' from the environment that it is safe to heal (a doctor, for example). [#NRC161013, SiriLeknes] also suppress pain by stimulating the reward centers in the brain; which can also increase brain activity in 'feeling centers' when a pleasant stimulus arrives (and decreasing the activity in the feeling-centers when presented with unpleasant stimuli).

Places: [#NS160716HowTheBrainMapsSpecialPlaces] Places with special meaning are mapped in the deeper layer of CA1, instead of just the superficial layer which creates a general navigational map.

Plague: [#Weiner128] The plague in Florence may have paved the way for their arts, as 2 generations later, Florence blossomed. Both because of instability (status quo broken) and inheritance effect (people had more money). Also church lost some of its authority since it had not stopped the plague – humanism also came into being

Plan: [#ForsD46] Plans can be useful but lose value as reality can interfere more. In most cases, one should focus on goals, not plans. Plans are just useful when there are deadlines and/or you need to coordinate with people. [#Baumeister] Who makes a plan, increases the chances he or she will execute it. [#White62] Plans/goals can be nice, but it's often beter to go for an opportunity than to wait for the right moment and until you have 'prepared sufficiently'. Know which steps are unnecessary [talk to those people who have achieved what you want to achieve]

Plan B: [#White99] If plan A does not work, go for a plan B: it just requires some courage, vitality and ingenuity, and a willingness to not always play by the rules.

Planck, Max: [#Crop231] Planck's search for truth was not really a purpose or a program, but by an emotional need, a 'hunger of the soul'. Intense, sometimes desperate search. Went to one of the best places to study physics, Berlin. His professors, Helmholtz and Kirchoff, were as lecturers less than inspiring, but in their writings Planck found what he sought. Still, he was not recognized for his first contributions, only when he sided with Helmholtz in a contest. Blackbody radiation research was blossoming because the measurement methods were quickly improving. Had studied the entropy problem for years, so could use it quite potently, however had exhausted his theoretical repertoire until he accepted Boltzmann's probablistic version of the entropy law. Still had a 'wild' adaptation of Boltzmann. Lived by his conscience. Devoted family man, skilled lecturer, talented musician, tireless mountaineer, formidable administrator, a mentor venerated by his junior colleagues, and an inspiration for all. Loved to play tag in the garden (so a bit of a child still). Lectures were somewhat dry, but exceedingly clear. Had quite a lot of administrative responsibilities, but was also a very good economist with his time. Had library, correspondence, and diaries! [#Seth96] Published enormous range of papers, diverse applications of his theories on the second law of the mechanical theory of heat. Tried to base all of physics on thermodynamics. But it was also handy that one might avoid mechanical modeling by that... Did not do experiments, nor (unlike Sommerfeld) look at experimental data. [funnily, was in priority dispute with Arrhenius, who was proud of discovering ions, while Planck did not know of or care about the properties of the particles). Did not like that assuming the existence of molecules would invalidate an absolute second law of thermodynamics [wanted to preserve beauty?]. Was more a teacher than a learner by working on chemical problems 'for' chemists. [#Seth121] Was willing and able to publicly revoke some earlier, untenable assumptions. [#122] Also carefully studied Boltzmann's work on the second law, exploiting what it suggested for his own purposes (even though before he had resisted and disliked Boltzmann's work!] Note that, despite being a theorist, Planck postulated certain restrictions beforehand, like Einstein would do on the speed of light. [#129] Apparently read Sommerfeld's papers and corresponded with him.

Planned behaviour: [#Tigg33] Planned behaviour is mostly used for rare occurrences where we have lots of time in advance to decide, and costs more energy than automatic behaviour.

Planning: [#Stol90] As a metacognitive skill, a good learner determines the objective, determines what needs to be done, and organizes time and resources appropriately. [#Davidson230] Planning may be trainable by focusing, when tempted, on your real goal instead.

Planning fallacy: [#Flourish233] Planners chronically understimate costs and overestimate benefits because they ignore the baseline statistics for problems that resemble theirs.

Plans: [#Isaacson186] Some investors (successful ones?) fund people, not plans. [#Schmid6] “Have you ever seen a team beat the plan?”

Plants: [#59sec123] Adding plants to an office increases the number of ideas of males, and more flexibility of solutions from females. Even seeing green ink may help!

Plateaus: [#EricB225] At least some plateaus are not necessary to reach expert performance {may be bad teaching/coaching on the plateau?} [#CoyleT108] Plateaus mean that you have reached automaticity in that skill – speed things up, slow things down, do things in reverse or do anything to change your practice method.

Plath: [#John134] Sylvia Plath was an exceedingly hard worker (like her father, who however also put a Prussian discipline on his family, and died when she was eight). Collected rejection strips which 'showed that she tried'. Frantic activity also kept her inner demons at bay. Feared failure {fixed mindset? achievement=worth}, and feared being abandoned by her husband.

Platinum rule: [RobertoCortez/EW] Treat others how they want to be treated.

Plausibility: [#Weng108] The most plausible ideas usually have been excuted already and can therefore be researched; the least plausible may contain an element that is really novel and can be used in this or other contexts.

Play: [#Imagine231] Enrolling children in a preschool that emphasizes unstructured play makes them score better on self-control, allocation of attention and working memory than letting them follow a more traditional curriculum. [#BatesonPlayBook] Fleming said, by way of a job description, that he 'played with microbes'. Play can generate totally novel ideas, normal 'exploration' is more cautious. Play-based art classes can increase originality, fluency and flexibility. [#Thagard4] Playing with ideas and instruments can be inherently enjoyable. [#DavidWhitebread, NS161113] Children who have been in a play-based program perform better at school than kids who had been academically directed. Possibly by making children more self-regulating, or by letting them learn that a cardboard box can be a spaceship

Playfulness: [#Edu] “Who wants to be a millionaire”-quiz system helps kids remember. [#NS20112010] Andre Geim: playfulness is a minor part of your work [EW: but like autonomy, freedom, keeps in the motivation?] [#Weiner87] Playfulness may be important.

Playing: [#Root03] Eleventh of 13 thinking tools. Doing something for the fun of it, breaking or bending rules, inventing new ones or new activities. Play doesn't serve a 'purpose', but can lead to new skills or discoveries: Feynman played with the plates.[#Howe163] The Brontës were immensely playful in their stories, and had lots of fun besides. {EW: good for experimenting, discovering new methods or things?} [#Grin112] Seventh of nine learning methods. It is also fun to play! (dopamine?) [#Ster217] A playful approach increases the chance of creative results. [#Ster410] Creative children are more playful than their less-creative peers. [#EW/Liv] Perhaps being able to play helps release stress, and my father may not have played nearly enough, being responsible and all... [#Bron167] Does playing teach abstract thinking ('this desk is a fire-engine')? [#NS090601] Playing may not teach specific skills per se, but more help with pruning connections during sensitive periods (or possibly enhance myelination in specific regions, though the pruning theory seems more convincing). Animal species with bigger brains play more. Rats denied the ability to play grow smaller neocortices and lose the ability to apply social rules; children predestined for schizophrenia similarly play less. [#C2W] “Play to Cure”: users may find interesting dots on microarrays better than scientists can.

Pleasure of uncertainty: [#Redirect60] Understanding and reducing uncertainty about negative events blunts their impact, but the same goes for positive events; having some mystery surrounding positive events prolongs the pleasure we get from them. Same information in question-and-answer format makes people think about a postive experience, such as a dollar given, less, and hence get back sooner to their default mood.

Pleasureable: [#Greene60] Many people believe that everything in life should be pleasureable, and therefore cannot push themselves through pain and boredom towards mastery.

Ploem, Bas: [#TonRaap] Paranoide, manipulatieve maar innovatieve wetenschapper.

Plussing: [#Imagine163] In criticism, always have a plus, to build on the flaws in a productive manner.

Podium personality: [#Tonn32] Geri Haliwell knew what she wanted in no uncertain terms, had a 'podium personality' that could deal (and even loved) the spotlights.

Poets: [#SimonB133] Poets have the record high of psychopathology, and the female poets are more often mentally ill than male poets, and are more likely to die by their own hands.

Polgar, Lazlo: [#Syed62] Polgar introduced his daughter Susan jovially into the game, making great drama of it.

Policy: [#Flourish164] Science does not make it into policy when the evidence mounts and mounts until it is compelling, but if the evidence is sufficient and the political will is present.

Politeness: [#Howe55] Darwin thanked people for their well-intentioned criticism, but generally kept to his own opinions and went his own way.

Political fragmentation: [#EricB328] Eminent creators are more likely to be born not in anarchy, but in political fragmentation, multiple independent states.

Political genius: [SimonB30] Leaders are ranked as greater as they were either morally better or more evil; moral mediocrity seems to be judged as political mediocrity as well.

Political openness: [#Simo213] Lack of suppression of minority groups and divergent opinions is good for proliferation of genius.

Political preference: [#NS07042012] Conservatives have a larger right amygdala (threat response, intense emotions), while liberals have more gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex; similarly, conservatives score lower on openness and higher on conscientousness. [#NS031112] Libertarians score differently from both liberals and conservatives, not simply a blending of the two. DRD4 7R associated with novelty-seeking behaviour and liberal politics. Conservatives have higher need for 'cognitive closure' – wanting to turn uncertainties in certainties and ambiguity in clarity; liberals have a higher need for cognition itself, enjoying deliberation and mental challenges. Liberals also unconsciously prefer high-status to low-status groups, just not as much as conservatives do. Conservatives are also more sensitive to digust cues, predicting unconscious attitudes towards gay men. And stronger 'bad is stronger than good'-effect. Liberals better able to control their impulses. [#NS031112”PoliticalInstincts”] Resistance to change and justification of inequality motivated by needs to manage uncertainty and threat (Political conservatism as motivated social cognition). Conservative rooms have more objects related to order: stamps, calendars, cleaning products. Liberals rooms with greater O (and messier). O and C.

Politics: [#EricB198] Sometimes, improving performance of or transferring knowledge from a group of people is hard, because that group has power-, money or status incentives to keep the status quo. [#Greene57] Observe the unwritten rules, observe who is successful and who is chastised, so you know how to survive in your environment. [#164] Also present in academia, and too much for some. In a group, politics and ego often trump sound decision making. [#Seth20] German engineers in 1850 sought social status by allying themselves with the intellectual 'elite' (the universities) and taking over their ideals of 'bildung' and pure over applied science [EW: similar to the Hogescholen now?] Politics may also influence job availability, and is therefore important (Technical universities offering temporary stay for theorists). Sommerfeld was consciously trying to show his use/or the use of mathematics in engineering, more than really solving some of the problems set before him. [#OomRob] Library was eliminated from 't Heim as soon as director got ill. [#Weiner176] Since Scotland was annexed by the English, intellect was driven away from politics into more fertile grounds [#EW: like popular writing takes time away from discovery?] [#Seligm164] Science does not make its way into politics due to slowly accumulating evidence. Just two elements: evidence must be sufficient, and political will must be present.

Polymath: [#Root] There is a difference between a polymath, who masters the knowledge and skills of several subjects, and a dillettante, who dabbles without depth in many fields. Polymathy may help the creative process by letting ideas or ways of thinking from one field seep into another. [#Crop28] Newton could be considered a case of polymathy, not only studying physics, but alchemy and theology as well.

Pond: [#Int310812] “Do you want to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?” {EW: small fish in big pond learns a lot more; but interviewee Coffee company preferred the other option.}

Pople: [#Hargit31] Pople left Cambridge for the US, since that had greater opportunities in computational chemistry, which was then an emerging field.

Popper, Karl: [#Strien337] Had two promotores, a psychologist and a philisopher, and contrasting their contrasting schools may have helped form him.

Popularity: [#NS270310] The most popular teenagers are also likely to sleep less, and use drugs. [#NRC011211] The popularity of (Dutch) movies depends on: what is the target audience, how much money and energy will be spent on marketing, and in how many cinemas is the film shown initially? Needs to be attended like seven times on the existence of the movie. Critic's judgement is rather unimportant. 'Dutch feeling' (like Elfstedentocht) helps. Branding (does a TV-series or book exist already, or is the director famous?). Concept: moral must be conventional. Good rewarded, evil punished, etc. 'Must-see'-factor (like naked model, or 3D). Subtility (like in 'Majesteit') does not work well.

Portable memory bank: [#Weng43] Every proper method for creativity recommends you have something to write down your ideas or observations (or tape them) with you all the time.

Portaits: [#NS271110] Pictures of eyes (or portraits of Mao) make people more honest or social.

Positive emotions: [#Switch122] Positive emotions may encourage us to 'broaden and build' our set of skills. [#Int210912] May increase alertness. [#Seligm199] Positive emotions strengthen the immune system more than negative emotions weaken it. Work also through lower interleukin-6, so less inflammation. [#Lyubom203] “Happy days”-technique: remembering happy times in the past increases your sensitivity to positive emotions in the weeks afterwards.

Positive focus: [#Mill50] Mill learned to be content with getting as much as possible what he could achieve, even if this sometimes wasn't much.

Positive psychologt: [#Flourish85] Increase language arts grades and writing skills.

Positive thinking: [#Syed166] Positive thinking can improve physiological performance, such as speed of execution.

Positivity ratio: [#SellHuman118] Frederickson, Positivity-book: should be between 3:1 and 11:1 positive to negative thoughts. [#Seligm66] 5:1 for marriage, 3+:1 for company.

Possessions: your possessions may give you virtual cognition, a cue to your identity and such.

Possibilities: [#Bloo488] Motivation may subside if people don't see further possibilities for development, no further place to go.

Post-traumatic growth: [#Flourish160] The more traumatic events someone has been through, the psychologically stronger they are. Perhaps due to shattered beliefs about self, others and the future, giving the chance to rebuild them in a better way? Creating a trauma narrative, and overarching life narratives and stances that are more resistant to challenge are formed.

Post-traumatic stress disorder: [#Flourish158] More than half of PTSD victims were in the bottom 15% of psychological health to begin with. [NRC06062013] NOP resceptor involved – blocking that decreases the chance of PTSD. [#Seligm154] Trauma is reexperienced often (like in bad dreams), emotional numbness (not feeling emotions, like joy or sadness). Lots of anxiety and guilt. Note that post-traumatic growth occurs much more often than PTSD. [#NS230716BrainTrainingForTroops] Part of what is causing PTSD may be avoiding negative stimuli; training troops to also look at negative pictures may help.

Posture: [#AmyCuddyTiggelaar] Standing in a 'strijdbare houding' (making oneself longer and broader than one is) for two minutes decreases coritsol and increases testosterone.

Potency: [#Csik96] Talented teenagers feel more potent (alert/excited) when reading or thinking and when alone. [#Csik143] Potency is increased while practicing athletics and music, not much for art, and not significantly for math or science.

Potential: [#SellHuman141] People find potential more interesting than accomplishment. Perhaps because it is more uncertain.

Poverty: [#PoorEcon] Poverty (99 cents per day) limits the amount of information you can get (no newspaper). So cannot deal with institutions – often cannot even read properly. [#11] A poverty trap may exist if small investments have little or no return (sigmoid curve) {EW: also whether fluctuations are deadly since small losses can be devastating and depressing} They draw curve of income today versus income tomorrow; may be poverty trap if tomorrow's income is below today's under a certain limit. Some people are too weak for physical work, too inexperienced for skilled labor, and too old to be apprentices. Lack of food makes people weak, listless, and prone to depression. Note that many poor could spend more money on food; but they spend it on alcohol, tobacco, or festivals {EW: but are they in their right mind? Depression?}, and on more tasty foodm instead of purely more raw calories or micronutrients. [EW: people buying meat or shrimps: may be for protein; saying that it is just taste may go a bit too far.] Witch hunts may have been a way of getting rid of unproductive mouths; {EW: India – so many vegetarians!} To prevent anemia, iron-fortified fish paste is an excellent investment (at least for self-employed workers); iodine pills to pregnant mothers help their children complete more schooling. Note though that many poor refuse to pay some cents for deworming [#NS111210] Deworming may work by reducing absenteeism/, even if it gives 100s of dollars extra in lifetime earnings! Also social 'save face' (spending on funerals) causes depression and dropping out of school. “Oh, but television is more important than food!” Boredom: spending either on festivals or television. And sometimes even 'rich' poor are not willing to buy things like bed nets, even though they can easily afford it and it is economically/rationally an excellent choice. Poor spend money on health, but more often on expensive cures rather than cheap prevention. Doctors in india underdiagnose and overmedicate {EW: like many programmers} Problem: health posts have great absenteeism (they get paid anyway), and also unfortunately low quality there. Bad education (lack of high school biology, no books/magazins) also makes beliefs about health dominant – after all, there is little observable evidence that a course of action works. Also there is hope, and 'doing something' is taken as a positive sign. 'Bribing', offering beans and a set of stainless steel plates for completing the immunization, works, even though many western people find that icky. Poor have large discounting the future, any cost or inconvenience bore today weighs heavily, can't you postpone the costs to tomorrow, when they are 'smaller'? Poor, like us, suffer from lack of information, weak beliefs, and procrastination. In rich countries we do not need to make so many decisions actively: we already have clean drinking water, and have to vaccinate our children for school. Paternalism has a bad name, but it even frees our time to be more productive as the most important choices are made (in a relatively well-informed way) for us. In poor countries, many teachers miss days at school (1 in 5 or higher) or are not teaching class but drinking tea and chatting with colleagues. [#80] It can help to pay parents to send their children to school, though in some lands unconditional transfers also help; the parents simply need money. [#82] Every extra year of primary school seems to raise wages by about 8% (at least in Indonesia) [#87] Parents see schools as ways that their children will become rich (by working for the government). But see schools as a lottery; very uncertain that a child will complete it. Also think that years of secondary school give much more benefit than of primary school (is not true). Due to limited resources, tend to 'pick a winner', and concentrate all resources on that one (making other children less likely to enroll). Expectations matter: in India, teachers forced to teach 'bad' students slack. And low-caste teachers grading low-caste students give lower grades to them. Parents not ineterested in evening classes and summer schools-children who need those are not going to win the lottery, so why make the effort? Teacher training not useful without also having volunteers in the classroom. Poor people, even when they are very intelligent need encouragement. KIPP and other charter schools assume that all children can master the basics, and evaluate constantly to find out what the children know. Telling parents that one more year in school for children with a background similar to theirs increases test scores so and so much, and what the real gains of education are, increases enrollment. Tracking can also help (since teachers can teach more effectively), at least tracking based on what children already know. And not much training necessary for being a good remedial teacher. Black Death in Britain may have caused higher wages in subsequent years. Family size does not seem to affect investment in education {though perhaps for extremely poor people it will}. Getting pregnant early in life may be bad for the health of the mother; and if there are more children and education is the same, it's the mother who 'pays the bill'. Fertility is not determined by access to contraceptives, more by how many children women want [and contraception availability in puberty!] Can reduce pregnancies (and AIDS) by saying that older men have a larger chance to be infected. Free school uniforms also help. But ABCD sex education undoes the effect, by focusing on marriage, which usually means an older man (as younger men can't afford it). If people have fewer children, they save more (but that money can't be invested in their children, so education level may not increase). Much depends on bargaining power woman: can she survive after divorce (education, possessions, laws...). Also the family is not 'one person', but its decisions are a result of relative power and bargaining. Though sometimes husband and wives have separate plots, derive their own income from their own plot, and competition and power-play determines who gets what, not overall efficiency considerations (though may prevent the freeloader effect). And much is not bargaining as such, it is simple using social rules, like not selling yams for clothing. Only maternal grandmothers tend to give much to their granddaughter (less certainty handicaps giving a lot?). Corrupt systems (police that has to be bribed to persecute debtors) help maintain bad economies. Loss of hope can make it even harder to get back ón top of the S-curve'. Also, risk gives worry, worry stress, stress cortisol, which negatively impacts decision making quality. S-curves make people also risk-avoidant and conservative (more than is 'rational', simply because losing money is out-of-proportion disastrous). But things that spread the risk still make poverty more likely: people work less hard on sharcropped land (and presumably, having too many occupations prevents decent specialisation). Generally efficiency versus flexibility problem. Mutual ínsurance' works relatively well, but still feel shocks, especially when a health problem is the cause. Sharing as moral individual duty than all in common pot. (healthcare is very expensive, much more than food). Moral hazard (people not doing their best when their backs are covered); adverse selection (bad for insurers if not mandatory), and fraud is a problem as well. And many people don't want mandatory enrollment. Trusting insurers is also an issue (even here! And with good cause...) Besides people may be (naturally irrationally) more averse to a fixed small loss than a chance large one. One solution may be that government pays part of the premium. On microcredit: one reason moneylenders charge such high interest rates is not because so many poor default (only like 2%), but because chasing uip debtors takes lots of time, especially since most are so poor that they can't or don't provide a collateral. Also, information is needed on the borrower, and that always takes time, even for small loans (which makes it expensive). So that's why most poor lend from people who know them, or are goons which can use violence to get what they want (horribly inefficient law enforcement,m 8 years for bankruocy, also doesn't help). Microfinance usually creates 'communities of borrowers' who keep social pressure on one another. Conditions may be too rigid for some, and another problem is that in many cases it's lack of entrepreneurship that's the problem, not lack of money. And also, requiring back-payments early, may discourage larger and more ambitious projects. Striving for zero default by microcredit financers may thereby harm their social purpose. [EW: look at history, how could rich countries ever become rich?] {joint liability may not be necessary, but weekly meetings are much better than monthly ones}. Very much impact on whether others seem to repay. Also hard zone where you are too large for microcredit and moneylenders and yet too small for banks. Saving: rotating groups can give money fast, and also good places to ask for advice. Since banks need to be secure and have lots of paperwork, there are too high administration costs for small deposits. Also “when the money is in the house, things always happen, and the money disappears”. (if the money is already spent on fertilizer, people tend to find alternatives). Temptation good: something that makes immediate claims on you, but does not give anticipatory pleasure. Limbic system only activates with rewards today. And what abot poor in NL or US? Are they different? [And what about the explanation that there are too few resources (or, due to history too uneven distribution of resources) to give everyone their basic wants? Even if fruit vendor's debts are paid, they always relapse sooner or later into debt, due to illness or emergency need. Any long-term goal, even a 'frivolous one' (a TV) can help cut back on frivolous dialy expenditures like tea or alcohol. Far goals are not that powerful (see procrastination). Still, giving people some capitalist asset and some financial 'support' for a period that they are not tempted to liquidate that asset can make people richer (EW: but in a virtuous cycle or just until expenditures again equal income, so a virtuous cycle or a jump to a slightly better orbit?). But many businesses of the poor are both small and unprofitable. Courses in 'business knowledge' also don't work, though the authors suggest because people have little hope (and therefore enthusiasm and expending energy) that they can save enough/work hard enough to make a difference. Simplified tips help (logically, people think in situatioin-action, not abstract stuff). Many women business owners do the business next to their child rearing – expanding the business jhust means working yet harder for them. Jobs (even factory jobs) are preferred by most poor, since they have more stability of income, and they work more hours. It's not mainly the salary, but the stability and certainty of the job that helps the psychological outlook. Problem: most jobs in city, but really bad housing there for the poor. Also, the 'social security' that is natural in villages is absent in cities, so risky. Press can help (13% of money reached schools in Uganda, became 80% after the politicians published it and it created uproar + communication between school leaders and government). Formal invitations through letters make it more likely that people will show up at a village meeting. Voting on caste can be relatively easily diminished by pupput shows and information; most people don't feel vert strongly about that issue. Note tha unrealistic expectations (nurses working 6 days a week) make people skimp duty. Asking parents and such to partcipate does not work well unless you make their tasks clear. Also for getting elected: having clear plans is better than clientilist messages (which itself works better than vague, nationalist plans) [NS070913] Poverty (at least the stress of financial worries) causes a 13-point drop in IQ. Possibly because financial worries eat up working memory (or sleep?) [#Bregma98] Children raised in poverty have bigger chance of behavioural problems, get in jail, stop education early, use more drugs and alcohol. [#102] Poverty costs about 13 IQ points

Power: [#Gawan100] A checklist can be a subtle way of redistributing power. [#Franzen267] McClelland distinguishes personalized power versus socialized power; personalized power is power for the power, status symbols [prototypical dictator], socialized power is power for a greater goal, less narcissism and more willing to share power. [#SellHuman71] People given more power do worse on the 'E'-test: have less empathy/understanding for other people's viewpoint. [#NS051111] If people get the opportunity to steal because being the chief, people will tend to steal more if there is more gain (more employees to bleed) and will become more corrupt over time. Interesting, are also more vocal in condemning immoral acts, though considered such acts as less blameworthy when carried out by themselves than when carried out by others. When primed to feel powerful, areas associated with disinhibition are activated. Psychological distance (not money, but bonds; or an intermediary/illusion of shared responsibility) also helps dishonest tendencies. Coming from a corrupt culture also helps, unless you're a grad student [then you may have chosen to flee the country of origin]. Creative people are more likely to be dishonest – easier for them to make a story about why it is okay to cheat. Fight corruption: increasing audits or even just sending a letter that a state audit agency is coming to look at the project. Accountability meetings don't make much difference, but centralized organ for anonymous complaints, coming in action when a treshold of complaints is reached, works. Also: power should come with more built-in checks and balances. [#NS271110] People primed to feel more powerful are more likely to objectify others, seeing them as disposable pawns rather than emotional humans. [#NS070712] Power increases testosterone, which increases the uptake of dopamine in the brain's reward network, which results in increasing egocentricity and reduced empathy and inhibition. [#NRC040513] Priming for power (thinking of a moment you felt powerful) makes people write better application letters.

Power law of learning: [#EricB510] The assumption that the number of trials needed for learning a chunk is proportional to the number of elements in the chunk. Indeed there is evidence that our knowledge is indeed organized in tree-structured chunks or a computer program, with abstract elements above, concrete actions below.

PPP: [C2W_131213_HerbruikbareEmeritus] Johan Sanders: innovatie heeft alledrie van People, Planet en Profit nodig. Je  kunt  zelfs in het begin niet 1 weglaten in de hoop dat het later wel komt.

PR: [#EW/Volkskrant] Schools and trainers are ultimately assessed on how useful/fun they seem. So if objective comparative data is not available, students may choose the schools that seem most fun or high-status or whatever. Unfortunately, lessons that seem effective are often not the same lessons as the lessons that are really effective.

Practical intelligence: [#EricB620] Practical intelligence does not seem to correlate to general intelligence, crystallized intelligence, personality, or even technical job knowledge! Shows however a good relation to everyday expertise. [#Pers142] The ability to do well in real-world jobs. Surprisingly, seems to be negatively correlated with scholastic success(!)

Practical learning: [#EW/Gabrielle] Schools giving practical learning seem to do so because they consider some students to prefer practice over theory. In fact, ALL students prefer practice; however, learning in practical ways is much more efficient than bare book-learning and is therefore more suitable for students who learn slowly. However, if practical learning would also be given to smarter students, those students may learn even faster than from books! {even though there may be some point where the learning rate becomes so fast that practice with setup and such slows learning down.}

Practicality: [#EW/#GladT?] Something is more persuasive/is perhaps even remembered better if a practical way is shown to accomplish act on it.

Practice design: [#Colv55] Experts such as Jim Rice design their practice to work on their specific needs. Generally one should isolate a specific important aspect of one's performance and focus on it till it is improved.

Practice duration: [#Colv71] For deliberate practice, 4-5 hours a day seems the maximum, usually divided over 60-90 minute sessions.

Praise: [#Coyl137] Works best when given rarely, only when it's earned, and praising hard work instead of intelligence or talent. [#Lieb27] Praise someone for 5 minutes and then briefly mention the behaviour he or she did, and say that it is unacceptable. Alternatively, promise him a treat or something else he or she likes, and THEN criticize: self-esteem works better that way. [#Bron14] Praising for intelligence does boost confidence, but only until a difficulty is encountered. Praising specific actions works best. Praise produces risk-aversity and lesser autonomy. Though it can also increase competition and the interest in tearing others down; also tend to inflate/lie more about their performance. [#Greene204] Criticism can strengthen us; praise generally does harm, as it shifts attention from the love for the creative process to love for attention. What must ultimately motivate you is the work and the process. Public attention is actually a nuisance and a distraction. [#Nass31] Since we don't process praise deeply, we tend to remember who praised us, but forget the specifics of the praise. [in contrast to criticism, which we remember very well!] [#Nass37] Does not consistently improve performance – makes some drive better, others worse. Generally, bodies relax after praise, unless it is extremely positive or very surprising. Perhaps flattery can also work because it is surprising (since it isn't even true). Rhyme and meter and repetition may make praise more memorable as well. [#Nass48] If people hear someone being praised, they adjust their own judgements to be also more positive about the person (or computer) being praised. [#Nass54] Self-praise makes people like you less, so mutual admiration works best.

Prayer: [#Syed152] Prayer is a great way to cope with stress and uncertainty.

Pre-arousal: [#Zill191] People who are already aroused like music better than people who were not aroused in advance.

Pre-imagining: [#Weng/EW] Imagining something easy (like a door) makes it easier to imagine more complex and unexpected things later.

Pre-lesson cases analysis: [#Clar152] Analyzing a related case before a lecture is given (analyzing a case ('what patterns do you see?) works better than merely reading about it). Useful to compensate for missing prior knowledge.

Pre-test: [#Clar389] Letting learners make a pre-test, asking for a show of hands at the beginning and giving the answers at the end may be a good way to stimulate interest. [#EW] Why should we push all people through the same programme: if someone finds something easy, why let that person perform elaborate representation? Do intense training for those who need it.

Pre-thinking: [#Weng/EW] By thinking about an aim you want to accomplish first, you make your mind more receptive (either when visualising or when doing chores/relaxing) to produce the desired answer. Also works for example when you aim to ask one question after a meeting – before the meeting even begins!

Precision: [#EW/Wolt] We remember unique things better; seeing and describing a situation more precisely (having a larger vocabulary, for example) would therefore help. {EW: would autism with its preference for details therefore help memory?}

Predict: [#Gold62] Asking people to predict whether they will vote (and provide reasons) makes them more likely to vote. This is mainly when they feel compelled to give socially acceptable answers. And people hate to not do what they claim.

Prediction of feedback: [#EricB511] Prediction of feedback is necessary for learning motor skills. {EW: and would prediction of an outcome also help learning?}

Predictions: [#EricB642] Prediction is the third level of situation awareness (first two levels are obtaining information and interpreting it to a situation), and experts spend more time doing it than novices. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/radical-teaching/201005/want-children-pay-attention-make-their-brains-curious] Letting students make predictions makes them more curious about the outcome. However, do not confirm or deny predictions, friendly 'thank you' suffices for now. [#NS191111] People are bad at predicting what they will like. We're also not very accurate at evaluating pain/pleasure in past; our idea of discomfort/total pain of a medical procedure not being influenced by its length, but like average between how they felt at its worst, and how they felt when it was ending. [#McGon95] Asking people to predict how much they will exercise in the next month is the same as asking them how much they would exercise in the ideal world – a gross overprediction; and when asked after they exercised for two weeks, made even higher predictions, as if their future self would make up for past lapses.

Predictors: [#Root] Two main predictors of succes in science is having >4 high impact publications by the age of 45 {EW: seems a bit circular} and investigation of a unusual diversity of concurrent research topics.

Preference reversal: [#SteelArt] The phenomenon that procrastinators plan to work, but change their minds, and only swap plans again just before the deadline (if then).

Prefrontal cortex: [#Kluw210] Damage to the prefrontal cortext may result in perseveration (not discarding a rule that is now inapplicable) as well as heightened susceptibility to distraction, next to problems with attention, memory and planning. {EW: similar to symptoms reputedly caused by autism?} {also looks a lot like stress response!} [#Kluw220] The prefrontal cortex may not directly inhibit less relevant signals, but strengthen the neurons producing the 'relevant signal' so much that those suppress their immediate competitors. [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvU44vB8X7E&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=5] Uses more energy than any other part of the brain, also enhances hunger (in for example afternoon) because it craves more glucose. Nap can also help. [#McGon14] upper left side of prefrontal cortex specializes in “I will”, right side of prefrontal cortex handles “I won't”. Bit lower and in the middle of the prefrontal cortex: “I want”. [#16] Inhibited by drunkenness, sleep-deprivation and distraction (thinking about something else, like work).

Prejudice: [#Redirect192] The most successful prejudice-decerasing programs are those which bring the two groups into contact with each other, under the right conditions. [sanctioned by authority, equal footing, shared goal]. Perhaps part is that people learn to know other as unique individual that does not fit the stereotype. Problem is that most people think/fear that 'they' are not interested in knowing you [EW: like networking?]. Tend to overestimate differences and underestimate commonalities if someone is of a different race. Writing about a time you formed an unexpected friendship can help, as does seeing a video of a two people of different races together [like student and professor for networking workshop?]. Connect drama's (stories?) with own experiences?

Premack Principle: [#Tigg246] Listing your tasks in order of enjoyment, doing the least enjoyable first.

Premature closure: [#EricB349] Premature closure is like prejudice or first impressions: one goes with his or her initial impressions, not considering all information afterwards, not paying attention to conflicting information {very anti-Darwin}.

Preparation: [#EricB44] Experts generally spend relatively more time in preparation/evaluating the initial situation than novices do. [#EricB329] The greatest composers seem to learn fastest (or had the best teachers?); have less time between start of instruction and first hit than others (and they also started lessons earlier). [#Scho181] Preparation of a task aids concentration later (perhaps because you do not need to take as many factors into account anymore)

Preschool: [#NRC200811] Children going to school before age 5 get better jobs, are better able to keep their family, and less often wind up in crime. Note that giving lessons in classes is not ideal for such young children, small groups are better, else you'll lose their attention, or you ask them what they are going to do, and then let them play in groups. [#NRC140214] JamesHeckman: each dollar invested on preschool programs will result in 8 dollars later for the government.

Present reality: [#ForsD28] Often it is more important to face one's present reality than to look at one's vision. Write down both the facts and your feelings about those facts.

Presenting: [#Tiggelaar] Most listeners lose attention after a while {note: goes for managers?} when presented with numbers, theories and models. They listen attentively to stories and examples, however. And they get their notebooks when they hear what they can do themselves today. [#Schmid152] Edward Tufte is a guru.

Presidents: [#Pers363] The greatest presidents tend to score high on openness, slightly higher on extroversion (especially more recent presidents), conscientuousness is not so important, and a slight disagreeableness helps. But there certainly is not one “presidential type”. Note that greatness was quite well correlated with lack of straightforwardness.

Press: [#Tonn85] Being able to be 'interesting' for the press can be very useful; though take note what image you want to have, depending on that choose interviews with the right newspapers or magazines. Which media provide best contact with the target audience? Make a publicity plan. And don't forget that you need not only talk about your work and fame, personal life and vulnerability makes you much more interesting. Practicing being interviewed with friends or family members, media trainers if you can afford it. For TV, have some snappy one-liners ready.

Press attention: [#Howe122] Press attention can damage a child prodigy.

Pressure: [#Csik130] Parental pressure may backfire in at least some cases to a student refusing to do the work, even though parental support seems craved. [#Syed182] Pressure can improve performance by novices by making them concentrate more. For experts, it can be deleterious, depending on how neurotic you are/how much you can leave fear out of your head.

Pretend: [#Bron166] Chilren who pretend to be soldiers can stand still much longer.

Pretraining preparation: [#Stol166] While post-training monitoring is important, more important is that people are briefed by their supervisors beforehand on the purpose of the training and the expectations of the supervisors, and that resources are freed for the people to apply their training on the job.

Price: [#Colv205] Many high achievers pay a price in the personal spheres; lesser social life or hobbies, and tend to sacrifice others to their own interests.

Price law: [#Simo150] The number of creators producing half of the work in any given field is about the square root of the total number of creators active. [#SimonB144] Does the law imply that the more contibutors there are, the more they push the eminent ones to the top? Or simply by being an effective audience?

Pride: [#Ferr222] Pride is stupid. Being able to quit things that don't work out for you is integral to being a winner. [#Franzen75] Is pride matching the ego to the ideal ego, and shame the inverse? [#DPink48] Women who could volunteer for donating blood and women who could choose to give their payment to charity donated blood equally often; perhaps it's pride that helps stay/become intrinsically motivated? [#McGoni204] pride even increases our willpower reserve! [#Hargit113] Milstein's (M84) father offered to support him financially so his son could do research, but his son refused, wanting to be independent. [#Nelissen145] An excess of pride can lead to overconfidence [which is dangerous]. You can also be proud of people associated with you (like your children). [#TiggelaarLastminutesuccesinjewerk] Thinking about who you want to make proud helps students with exams.

Priestley: [#Jaff44] First destined to become a preacher, but dissenting, he taught languages and learned a bit of chemistry and anatomy. His curiosity was aroused by being encouraged by Franklin to write a history of electricity, in which certain facts contradicted each other. First experimented in local brewery. Part was blind experimenting (what would happen if you'd bring a candle into HgO-developed air?, being lucky enough to have a burning candle near) even though Priestley had experimented with burning things before with CO2, so it was not really very coincidental. But even Priestley found it hard to shake the phlogiston-theory. Also had lots of contacts, was member of the Lunar Society, a scientific club founded by Erasmus Darwin, with also James Watt and other local notables as members. Was not afraid to vent his opinion against injustice. Knew (and taught) many languages, studied chemistry and anatomy. Got medal for creating CO2-saturated water {EW: encouraged him to proceed?} Was not too interested in the protests of his flock. Was also at least somewhat familiar with what other people had done before, like Rutherford's experiments with air. {Played the flute?} Thought of all kinds of applications of oxygen as well. Was most productive when a protector offered Priestley a job as his librarian and paid him well with enough spare time. Also told about his experiments to Lavoisier. Emigrated to USA when English nationalists continued to spoil his life. In the USA did not accept professorships or other jobs, but went to live with his sons and perform chemical experiments. Stayed in correspondence though with his lunar society friends, and participated in the American Philosophical Society. Was quite accurate (correcting manuscripts even on his deathbed), but was unable to leave phlogiston behind.

Priming: [#Ster198] Giving someone examples enlarges the chance that they will create things that have the same features as the examples, even when explicitly told to make the design as different as possible! Even negative examples (avoid this) are incorporated. Close, wrong solutions can block creativity. [#Zill190] Seeing something on TV, like an antisocial rock video, makes people more accepting of antisocial behaviour. Priming by watching 'slutty' black female singers primed test subjects to more easily label black women as sleazy. [#Loeh177] When trying to get rid of a counterproductive behaviour, formulate it as “ When I am tempted to do X, I'll do Y instead.”  [#NS220314YourCheatingBrain] Some priming experiments (on the bingo with 'old' words) did not work by the words, but by the expectation of the interviewer – letting the priming be done by computer abolished the effect. And seeing a photograph of a person winning a race may make your grant raising more successful (try before dates?) Seeing suicide of woman increased by 2% to 12% by first reading story about depressed woman. So subconscious takes stock... “no smoking” signs increase smoking due to difficulties of negation

Prior achievement: [#Hatt39] Prior achievement is the best predictor for success in school. Seems to be related to IQ, but undoubtedly part of it is self-image/self-confidence, prior knowledge, etc., so not purely an 'intelligence' kind of thing. Or should we say: 'if you DO and THINK the same as you did last year, your grades will be about equal' instead of the implied 'if you ARE the same person as last year, your grades will be about equal'.

Prior knowledge: [#Clar141] Always activate prior knowledge before the main lesson! Be wary though not to activated inappropriate prior knowledge, and take care to supplement prior knowledge for learners who lack it. 81% of learning is determined by prior knowledge! Avoid 'dramatic' introductions that activate the wrong kind of prior knowledge! Prior knowledge can be activated by group discussion of a problem related to the content. Group discussion in this is superior to reading about the problem and trying to find answers for oneself, and definitely superior to just trying to recall everything you know about the general subject (such as osmosis). Group discussion and problem reviewing have independent positive effects. Asking and answering 'pre-questions' is a second prior knowledge activation tool. Third tool: advance organizers. Comparative advance organizers activate prior knowledge (usually by making a comparison between familiar and unfamiliar knowledge, such as christianity and buddhism), expository advance organizers provide new knowledge to serve as a base for the integration of new lesson content, used when learners have little useful prior knowledge. Expository organizers can be outlines, or schema's (hierarchical schemas best for novices) [#Howe184] The Wright brothers carefully studied what other inventors had already done, they certainly didn't start from a vacuum. [#Clar40] Learners with little prior knowledge profit most from a directive architecture; if they have much prior knowledge, receptive, guided discovery or exploratory works better. [#Clar159] Learners with extensive related prior knowledge do not need prior knowledge activation, if they have some, do use the activation. [#Stol36] Prior knowledge in an area helps learners learn faster (stronger links, faster connections made, larger chunks?). The more you know about something, the easier it is to acquire additional knowledge and skills in that subject (the Matthew effect, in contrast to the students sinking swamp). Compensate for differences with peer tutoring pairs or (references to) supplementary material.

Privacy: [#Ster42] Very creative persons have a higher need for privacy. [#Franzen101] Privcacy and being alone seems necessary to think about things. [#EW] Explaining the behaviour of others can be highly offensive to some (think Els Das), especially to people who either have been hurt or are extremely sensitive to rejection (being as neurotic als Els does not help either).

Private schools: [#Geowissen09] If you correct for social background, private schools don't perform better than public schools (at least in Germany)

Private spaces: [#Weiner193] Private spaces may hoard dots / more chance of getting a random new idea in a chaotic public space?

Prizing: [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/special-education/201102/praising-kids-is-not-enough] Mentioning to someone, again and again, the one special 'spark' about them that strikes you {EW: like compelling unique feature?}

Pro-Am: [#Robi205] Someone who does not do something for a living, but has passion for it and aims for professional standards, making sacrifices for his or her 'hobby' when needed.

Probability: [#EW/CIA/GladT] What one expects/remembers is usually skewed to what scenario is more vivid/emotional/important. This is not necessarily related to what one wants; and it is also possible that the emotional scenario is outweighed by the probable one (familiar things are remembered better; and unfamiliar things are often distorted to familiar things in memory).

Problem based learning: [#Clar142] Popular instructional technique, in which groups of size 5 to 7 discuss a problem, from possible causes to potential solutions. [#Clar284] Problem-based learning may motivate the students more, unless it causes too much cognitive load, more structure and direction is then required. Four characteristics: relies on students to indentify and review knowledge needed, authentic problem given prior to any preparation or study, small-group collaborative work supported with self-directed study, use of the problem to identify the required knowledge, as well as the problem-solving skills. Does not lead to better learning of science knowledge and facts (seems even a bit worse), but leads to somewhat better clinical problem-solving. PBL does motivate students more though. There are some requirements for it to work: problems should be complex, ill-structured, open-ended and balanced (no clear yes/no, must be room for arguments. Also: cover all needed material!). Facilitators should be experts in learning (not so much in content). Note that dominant or silent students can interfere with the discussion. Case-based learning is version of PBL with more directive facilitators, and reading before getting the problem. PBL works better the more the cases resemble the experience, and the better-quality the recommended resources. [#Hatt211] PBL is worse for learning facts, but recall for the facts that are learned is better, and skills and understanding are better as well.

Problem finding: [#Ster84] Finding the right problem may even be more important than solving it! {EW: look at successful scientists!} [#SellHuman128] Investigation of Csikszentmihalyi: about 36 young artists, needed to select objects and make stilllife. Some artists made quick selection and went to drawing, others handled many objects, arranged them in different ways. Experts deemed the work of the second group far more creative. After 6 years, half of students had left art world, others were working and succeeding as professional artists – almost all of them were problem finders. 18 year later still much more successful; quality of problem found seems to have been more important than craftmanship. Problem finders sort through vast amounts of information and input, often of multiple disciplines; experiment with a variety of different approaches; are willing to switch directions in the course of a project, and often take longer than their counterparts to complete their work. “Problem Finding, Problem Solving” by Haas School of business at UcalBerk. Superintendents rank problem solving no 1; employees rank it 8, their number 1 is “problem identification”. [#Hargit167] John Polanyi: learned from his supervisors where the field was going, what were the most important questions to tackle, and, to a degree, how to tackle them.[#EricB170] Problem finding is often also important in real-world situations {for a scientist, for example} [#Rost99] It is important for eminent artists (C's work), and eminent scientists/artists spend more time on problem finding (that is, orienting themselves on a problem building toys)

Problem solving: [#Stol162] Best way to learn to solve problems is to study worked-out problems and partially worked-out problems, not try tackle every new thing by yourself. [#Simo65] The more complex a problem, the more ways of attack there are and may be needed, and the more dead ends, the more search becomes “blind/random”. [#NS31122011] For verbal problems, a break from the clue seems to be more fruitful if you occupy yourself with another task, such as drawing a picture or reading (Psychological Bulletin, vol 135, p 94). Some alcohol can help men solve word puzzles [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012000037], possibly by letting the mind wander more. [#NS24032012] Adult animals are generallty better problem solvers than young ones {more life experience?} but young animals generally learn better. [#NS140810] Parrots solve problems faster if they are allowed some time to study the setup before attempting to break it {EW: but total problem solving time?} [#Seth64] Letting students solve problems may help them gradually to see new problems as versions of old problems that already have been solved. [#Adams7] Sometimes the problem doesn't exist at all (solar panel extension damage). And sometimes extensive regulation (like laws) help prevent bad 'hit-and-run'-solutions since they force bigger effort on conceptualisation. [#Adams22] Requires proper problem-identification. Difficulty in isolating the problem is often caused by our tendency to spend a minimum of effort on the problem definition in order to get to the important matter of solving it. Try alternative ways of stating the problem. The more broadly the problem is stated, the more room there is for conceptualization. (even though you can go overboard – keeping a windshield clean by doing away with cars may not be what you want). Note that removing limits generally also gets you into interdisciplinary areas.[#Watt165] How effective is problem solving as a method for learning? {EW: not so much, according to Stolovitch; worked problems work better in most cases} [#Medi208] Problem solving is enhanced by a multimodel (multi-senses) presentation of the problem. [#Gawan68] To solve a problem, schedule that the critical(=relevant) people talk.

Problem-solving teaching: [#Hatt210] d=0.61, better effect if teachers have trained in heuristic methods. A full problem statement, with diagrams and such, leads to better solutions. The person with the problem does not always see his/her problem clearly (for example: more delicate machinery – or thicker-skinned tomato?).

Problems: [#Hold37] If you focus so much on your problems that you get depressed, you are focussing too much on them, focus on the happy things in your life instead for a while. [#EW/Collegezweet] Make them think! [#NS121013] Interview Sara Seager: [I try] to solve problems the way I would solve them at work: what is the real problem I have to solve, not just what does it look like? [#Catmul154] Big problems are self-similar to small problems (fractal-like?), and tend to require the same kind of approach. [#Muraka/EW] Why don’t people ask for advice or help when they feel troubled?

Procedural knowledge: [#Gall11] Doing things well can be hampered by telling yourself to do them well or how to do them; declarative knowledge interferes with the proper action of the procedural system. “Distracting” your procedural mind by focusing on something unemotional, like the seams on the ball, helps combat this. [#Kluw101] While input-output and output-input conversion are as fast as each other initially when learning a task, the input-output part becomes much faster as the procedure is automated

Process knowledge: [#Clar191] Teaching people how something works builds a cause-and-effect mental model, which is very handy for design and troubleshooting work.

Process over outcome: [#Myst42] Don't aim for scoring, aim to perfect the process. Caring about the outcome cramps your style.

Processing speed: [#EricB590] Also known as Gs, involved in almost all intellectual tasks.

Procrastination: [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczT-GYJ9wY&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=6] Two types: those procrastinating out of fear of doing a lousy job (need to address their fears, like break it down in small steps, pat themselves on the back) and those procrastinating because they don't care (need deadlines, competition, putting presure on themselves, quick punishments/rewards, creating own deadlines) [#EW] Would procrastination/distracting tasks be caused/increased by tiredness or lots of negative thoughts [so antidepri could help?] Or low self-efficacy/confidence? [#Steel10] Generally goes in three phases: I can do this later, it isn't due until..., then anxiety and doing diversionary things to quell it [immediate relief, escape, rewards – EW: against stress?], finally 'snapping' and going through a last-minute sprint, where your energy may or may not last long enough for. Impulsiveness is the greatest cause for procrastination, perfectionism barely though leads to overreporting. Expectancy, value, impulsiveness and time/delay all play a role in the equation, together with the available alternatives. [#Steel38] Procrastinators make similar plans to other people, but they tend to fail to act on those plans. [#Steel46] Failing to plan exaberates impulsiveness, though. “Now” activates the limbic system, the future is delegated to the prefrontal cortex. Alcohol, amphetamines or cocaine either stimulate the limbic system or deactivate the prefrontal cortex; or the prefrontal cortex is exhausted by sleeplessness, stress, or previous use of willpower. [#Steel174] Typically, procrastinators don't reward themselves after hard work, while that actually is very good, especially self-praise can work, possibly other rewards too [but do material rewards decrease intrinsic motivation?] Unscheduling works [planning nice things first, chores second] Abstract thinking about temptations works as well. [EW: numerical value: one death is a tragedy, a million a statistic?] Also eliminate external cues; keep work and private stuff separate (separate workspaces? Separate computers or user accounts?) Mini-goals (immediate or 5-10 minutes) and day goals are all good. Keeping track of time spent helps, as do routines. [#SteelArt] Procrastination increases if frivolous but enjoyable workplace activities are easily (or immediately) obtainable. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201201/question-help-procrastinators-hedonists-and-reality-tv-addicts] To diminish procrastination, don't ask yourself what will be more pleasurable, but what will be more meaningful. [#Burkem70] You do not need to change your feelings before you can do something, you merely need to accept them first. [#NS260817TheEndOfPainfulProcrastination] Procrastination can be combated by setting goals, removing distractions, and rewarding successes. Note that group therapy has longer-lasting effects than internet therapy.[#NS] Thought by at least one researcher, the motivation to complete a task is proportional to expectancy of good completion x size of reward / immediacy factor * personal delay tendencies. [#Scho40] Failure to not having done something can be structurally weakening.[#EW] Whatever happens when people keep postponing something important but unpleasant. Procrastination is seldom functional, but can be understood by psychology. Rationally, people of a set of options 1..n should always choose that option that gives on the probability-reward-time-integral the optimal yield (even though what is optimal may depend on circumstances/differ in time, after a period of fasting eating would become the most important thing to do, else other things should be preferred). Procrastination is more pronounced the farther away, smaller (perceived) or smaller probability it seems to have (and of course whether there are fun alternatives). Ways to deal with procrastination can involve eliminating other options (letting your editor stay in your hotelroom), making intermediate deadlines with small attached rewards, or telling stories that make the perceived probability of success greater, or imagining the rewards of success more vividly. [#Pers232] Procrastination predicts less success in almost all spheres of life. But it can partly be cured by setting lots of smaller deadlines. One reason for procrastination is simple uncertainty on how to do a task (then: see starting/doing as more important than 'doing well'). Another reason is having more pleasurable activities to choose from. Third possible reason is resentment of having to do the task – feeling as if it is “put upon you”. Cure for that is to focus on the things that ARE meaningful or pleasurable you, and remind yourself you cannot enjoy them while there are tasks undone. Trick: start in a very small way, and then get immediate positive feedback on how you're doing. Or: in what order do you want to do tasks? [#Burn86] “When I think about that undone task, which thoughts do then immediately come to mind?” Anhedonia can also stimulate procrastination, as can fear of failure/success/disapproval, perfectionism, helplessness, hopelessness, coercion, low frustration tolerance, guilt/self-blame. Methods that can help are a daily activity schedule, an antiprocrastination sheet, pleasure predicting sheet, but-rebuttal and challenging your negative thoughts, little steps for little feet, or set time limitations, translate shoulds into wants, visualize success (after listing the advantages of the behaviour), count what counts, test your can'ts, use a 'can't lose'-system (how can you handle failure?). [#NS151207] Procrastination is bad for tax returns, bad for student's grades (people don't do their best work on the deadline), and health. Men and younger people procrastinate more, perfectionists not so much but they worry about it more. Four factors: how confident a person is of completing the task, how easily distracted he/she is, how boring or unpleasant the task is, and how immediate the reward for completion will be.

Prodigies: [#Howe137] Child prodigies claim much more attention when they excel in something like chess or tennis; relatively few scientists and writers were considered prodigies, since whereas they often were very good, their gifts and achievements were not yet so obvious. [#http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121109111246.htm] IQ does not need to be extremely high for a prodigy, but working memory is generally in the 99th percentile. Next to that, attention to detail is extreme (many also have other autistic traits, relatively high occurrence of autism in their families).

Product: [#Tonn38] Great artists know what 'product' the public wants, but have a strong personality at the same time so they don't follow all whims of the audience.

Productive failure: theory that working on a problem unsuccessfully increases the far transfer when the fact actually is learned later. In some respects the theory is believable (just doing things that are too easy, like reading a prayer from paper, don't make things stick in memory), but the research on productive failure is polluted as traditional teacher-centered instruction is compared with the effects of discussion in small groups. Which is basically one of the things that Sommerfeld did/stimulated. Kind of inverse to the silent struggling we do at IntelliMagic (or of the romanticized mathematician).

Productivity: [#Eyse38] Productivity is highly linked to eminence, but unequally distributed: the sqrt(K) contributors in a field with K contributors make out half of all publications in the field. [#Hargit146] Max Planck institutes do better research, but citations are twice as expensive as in competing institutions. [#Adams148] People produce more when they feel noticed, and if they are warmly and humanely managed. [#SimonB101] You can fire half of all scientists on earth and still lose only 15% of productivity [EW: how measured? Number of citations?] [#http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/12/working-hours?fsrc=scn/fb/te/bl/ed/proofthatyoushouldgetalife / http://ftp.iza.org/dp8129.pdf ] over 50 hours of work per week (at least in production professions) does not result in much if any extra productivity; someone working 74 hour weeks does not produce more than someone at 50-hour weeks.[#Feist23] Productivity of Nobel Prize winnes almost always declines as the nonscientific demands on their time increase dramatically.

Professional development: [#McK] Best-practice countries let teachers spend 10% of their time on professional development {EW: would that be the optimal ratio?}

Professional teachers: [#Colv30] Tiger Woods, after being trained by his father, started studying under professional golf teachers at 4 years.

Professionalism: [#EW] Professionalism is usually associated with independence and doing what is best for the client/patient. However, growing influence of managers in education and healthcare tends to force professionals in standard protocols and high work pressure, seldom allowing them to use their best judgement and limiting their freedom. [#Gawan182] Professionals should be self-sacrificing (caring for others above their own benefit), skillful and trustworthy (decent personal behaviour towards one's charges) [#EW090313] A true professional should solve with best practices (whether that is a computer program, a checklist, or a script) what can be solved with best practices, and use creativity and knowledge where 'best practices' are too vague or insufficient. Teachers not wanting to teach from scripts are not professionals at that point; actually they lack skill, and should only teach unaided when they learn that skill, until then they're just arrogant amateurs.

Professionals: [#Susski27] Developments are that professionals are changing from independents to salaried employees, and the focus goes from service to money.

Professor: [#C2W_carriere_2013] Hermen overkleeft “Af en toe hebben we hier een enkeling die zeker weet dat hij voor een hoogleraarschap wil gaan” (and says that they usually succeed, because he selects PhD-students thoroughly) Of 35 promovendi, 8 built on an academic career (partly by emigrating). Others find places in institutes, education, medical sector or industry. For industry research, a PhD is a must, but postdocs almost useless; companies don't like to hire people above 30 year old, too much cultural switch. Professors need to encourage students to apply for money if they want to stay in academia, or make contacts if they want to go to industry; the second year of promotion should be clear what to do.

Programme: [#Arno82] One should neither pursue a program with too much rigidity, nor with too much lack of discipline. Find the golden middle road, hard though it is.

Programming: [#NS170713] People who started coding somewhere in the range of 8 to 11 years of age were most likely to develop advanced coding skills.

Progress: [#Bloo516] Keeping records of progress can work very motivating. {EW: but how to do it in scientific fields?} [#Ster345] Cultures which believe in progress may foster creativity more than cultures that do not. [#Loeh180] Setting time aside each day to check progress is important. For example, by a daily accountability log. [#Switch129] Sense of progress is critical, since elephant in us is easily demoralized. [#Hargit96] Feynman compared progress to cracking a safe: you don't know if you're getting there before you opened it, but you in any case know the numbers that did not work. Also: research is not going from mountain top to mountain top, you have to be in the valley first, and that takes time and freedom (so lots of unspectacular preparatory work). [#Weiner70] You can actually stop progress; the printing press was already invented in the Song dynasty, but it vanished without a trace.

Project mood chart: [#Heath168] U-shaped curve: high at start and end (hope, confidence), low in middle (insight).

Project size: [#Catmul209] Small projects (‘shorts’) actually did not lead to technological breakthroughs, but had other advantages: people working on them developed a wider range of skills, and built more long-term, cross-disciplinary connections.

Projects: [#Fors115] You can create projects, which are collections of related tasks (such as writing a musical is a project). Usually the main difference between a task and a project is whether you'll complete it in one go. “What needs to be done now” is a good question to ask of any project. [#Lyubom213] Find a happy person and you’ll find a project.

Promise: [#Tigg188] Making promises to ourselves or others makes it more difficult to back out of an important plan. [#http://www.intermediair.nl/carriere/werk-en-leven/collegas-en-bazen/Doe-vooral-niet-meer-dan-je-beloofd-hebt?utm_source=nieuwsbrief&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=wk22&utm_campaign=traffic] People won't forgive broken promises, but exceeding promises doesn't give extra kudos – people expect that external factors made you do it.

Promotion pride: [#Pers10] Challenging situations remind people with promotion pride of past successes and incites them to do better than before – people with prevention pride are however motivated to prevent past failures.

Proprioceptive psychology: [#NS15102011] The state of the body influences the mind: crossing your arms can make you more persistent, walking backwards, tensing your muscles or having a full bladder strengthens your willpower, if you have frozen frown muscles you take longer to read sad or angry sentences, children learn much more quickly, and understand more, if they're encouraged to play-act what they're reading, and if children gesture they remember the material more quickly and remember what they've learned for longer.[Anagrams are solved 10% faster when lying down compared to standing. Stretching out your left arm or bend your right arm at the elbow ('the Thinker') makes you find more uses for an everyday object, even eye movements left and right across your field of vision work. ?AmyCuddy? [#NS240617TryAPowerPose] Volunteers who stood like superman for a miute or so (legs akimbo, hands on hips and elbows bent) were later rated as better performers. (and handshake UnivAlabama 3-4 seconds, strong, and with eye contact.

Proteanism: [#Simo107] The ability of people to behave unpredictably, which can give advantages over a foe; may be correlated to psychological disorder, and therefore keeping the pscychological-disorder genes in the genepool.

Protest: [#NS290613] Most protestors are not the really poor, but the newly prosperous who fear falling back into poverty. And unemployed young people are the epidemic's carriers (especially via facebook and social media)

Proust, Marcel: [#Greene249] Had serious disease at age 9, almost died (making him doubt his longevity), passion for reading books. France had tradition of salons where intellectuals gathered. Turned his fascination from books to high society. Wanted to be a writer, but didn't know what he wanted to write about. Studied people as he studied ants, being very charming, and hearing everything about a love affair from the person's partner. Probably bisexual. First novel 'pleasures and days' a flop, the opposite (a novel on the entire history of society) lacked a theme. Felt like a failure in contrast to his friends from high school, which had careers and families.Trained himself in writing by translating the works of Ruskin. When he needed a character for his book, he'd hunt down the equivalent in society, studying him or her. If he couldn't gather information himself, would pay others to supply him information, gossip, even do some spying. [#260] Bouts of depression, but tireless and tenacious in gathering new knowledge.

Proximity: [#SteelArt] Impulsive individuals may require more separate subgoals, which means 'managing by proximity'/'management by emergency'.

Pruning: [#Simo17] Happens with the brain, in which lots of connections are made in infancy, and only the best ones kept. Reminds one of Linus Pauling's saying “The best way to get ideas is to get lots of ideas, and then throw away the bad ones.” [#NRC230711] Immune cells (microglia) help pruning not-very-active synapses [EW: relationship between autism and immunity problems?]

PSE: [#Gosl89] Picture Story Tests are very useful to discern other people's needs, such as need for affection, power and achievement.

Pseudoserendipity: [#Strien141] Having an open mind for hints, having enough knowledge and imagination and motivation/perseverance to make a theory/invention out of an observation, and being sufficiently obessed by the problem.

Psilocybin: [NS230416SocialTrips] Psilocybin helps people cope with being socially excluded. [#NS230814IntoTheMindOfBabes] Deactivates hubs like the posterior cinguate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex, and also reduces long-range connectivity between brain regions.

Psychic health: [#StenTurk110613] According to Sten, most psychic problems go when people learn to 'loslaten' (let go?) and have trust/faith. Then also other 'annoying things' in their day are not that annoying anymore

Psychic hygiene: [#Parr28] The interaction of someone with his or her social network; is it stabilizing or disrupting them?

Psychic resilience: [#Parr28] The ability of a student to deal with the stresses of student life.

Psychological difficulties: [#NRC130713_Korebrits] 85% of problem children (autism etc.) are from single-mom families [EW: does lacking a father exaberate problems? Or did people divorce because father had residues of behavioural problems himself?] If parents are not happy, children feel that, even autistic children 'alles hangt met alles samen'.

Psychological interventions: [#EW/Seligm83] One of the hardest things about psychological intervention is proper teaching – the Penn Resiliency Program works best if the teachers have been very-well trained themselves. [#Seligm95] Also via phone/apps? [#Lyubom127] Interventions may not work if they are applied too often (daily instead of weekly), too 'undeep' (minutes instead of hours) or with lack of variation

Psychological safety: [#EricB444] Psychological safety, a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking, is important for team effectiveness. If there is psych safety, teams view failure as a learning opportunity and seek feedback from outside sources.

Psychological Science in the Public Interest: journal; investigate!

Psychologists: [#SimonB90] In general, fame as a psychologist correlated to how extreme/ridiculous their positions were in important debates (for example Skinner), instead of how correct their position is.

Psychology: [#EW] It is rather senseless to try optimize human performance if you don't know how human performance works. [#Nett44] Most correlations/predictive powers in psychology are rather low. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2012/grote-verschillen.html?utm_source=120320-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=grote-verschillen&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] De strekking van advies inzake TBS hangt wellicht evenzeer samen met kenmerken van de gedragsdeskundigen die in strafzaken worden ingeschakeld, als met kenmerken van verdachtendie worden onderzocht. {EW: psychology far from an exact science yet} [#EW] Psychology is still rather in ‘dark ages: some stuff works, but we usually don’t know why. And even when we can explain/’explain’ something, we usually cannot use that knowledge to reliably predict the effect of a modification or of another intervention.

Psychology of science: [#Feistxii] Goals may be to help the gatekeepers of science discover and retain scientific talent. EW: motivate/recruit, select, educate, nourish, boost

Psychopathology: [#Eyse117] Psychopathology is suspiciously prevalent in eminent people, though scientists are relatively stable (only 18% had severe psychopathology) while artists, writers and composers are relatively unstable (30-40%) {Eysenck notes though that psychiatrists are notoriously bad/unreliable diagnosticians}

Psychosis: [#Eyes204] Psychosis is likely to occur under environmental stress with an increasing chance the greater the psychoticism of a person. It seems that there is a major factor for psychosis, and only some secondary factors pushing it to sides of schizophrenia or depression (or is depression relatively light, schizophrenia the heavy side of psychosis, with manic depression and schizo-affective in between?}. [#Inet] Infection/immune reaction of mother during first 20-40 days of pregnancy also seems to 	increase the risk of autism/schizophrenia. {EW: so may be second useful factor} Extraversion and (perhaps) neuroticity may also influence the type of psychosis.

Psychoticism: [#EW] One of the dimensions of Eynsenck, would be correlated to genius. But does it look like Asperger's in lack of conformity and lower sociality? [lesser agreeableness would be common, but Asp would show higher conscientousness. Asp has higher nervousness/neurocity however. Asp: low E/A, high N} P-scores go down with age. Adolescent and young males have highest P-scores of any age and gender. Young women are by the way more attracted to heavy metal (high P) men. [#Simo101] Correlates to divergent thinking, and also correlates to a weakened ability to filter out both environmental stimulation as the 'natural' boundary of ideas.

PTSD: [#NS170916TheAftermath] One can be protected a bit against PTSD by getting doses of oestrogen/testosteron or stress hormones after a trauma. Larger hippocampus protects somewhat, as does being male. Sexual trauma is most likely to cause PTSD. Traumas in childhood may also cause epigenetic changes in immune system and CNS development. Anyway, is likely not one monolithic disorder.

Publish: [#Crop21] Hooke was eager to pubish even the slightest hint of an idea, while Newton and Huygens kept working at things in secret and could occasionally be passed by their faster colleagues {did this have to do with extraversion, or desire to be recognized? Or fear to be wrong?}. [#Hargit193] Sometimes you have the wrong editor, or you will find a better reception in another field; When Edelman wanted to publish his findings that an antibody consisted of multiple chains, after sending it to a medical journal he sent it to a chemical journal who did not consider his idea so impossible. Many people don't check your idea, and simply reject it to be impossible. Cyclic reactions were rejected by the chemists, but not by the biophysicists who apparently did not think of the second law of thermodynamics. Sometimes the editors or referees think there is no interest in the publication.The ozone layer- CFK story was published in nature, but didn't have much effect then; neither did sending it to the local newspaper. Labeling it as a report of the energy commission allowed them to distibute it to hundreds of chemists at a conference, then Associated Press picked up the story. [EW: so moral: try, try again, and try smarter]. Nirenberg used his contacts to submit his papers to the PNAS – but his first sponsor refused after two papers “had done enough”. Then went to Szilard. Quite some Nobel-prize winning discoveries were rejected, either by the experts or the editors. Sometimes it worked simply sending it to another journal. Bragg: publish results promptly, lucidly and concisely. And yes, often people will claim that they thought of something before; but then the author lacked the courage, enthusiasm or clarity to push that discovery through.

Punishment: [#EW] Punishing people for making mistakes or not following regulations to the letter makes them risk-avoidant and 'stupid', always doing things 'by the book' even though the standard procedures are clearly not applicable. [#Tigg145] Administering something that is considered unpleasant by the subject or taking away something that is considered pleasant. [#NS271110PunitiveActsLinkedToReligiousThoughts] People who donate to religious causes punish misbehaviour more severely, even at cost to themselves, than 'normal' people, but only if they have been primed with religious words (like 'holy') or secular punishment concepts.

Punishment/reward: [#Myst173] Follow up a punishment with test/reward, that way YOU are not the bad person.

Puppy dog close: [#Ferr100] In sales, offering someone to try out a puppydog and return it if not according to wishes. They seldom do. In life: don't pretend not attending a meeting is permanent, and that you will keep yourself up-to-date.

Purple cow: [#Newport188] You need to be remarkable otherwise you'll be forgotten. The world is full of brown cows. Have a purple cow. Was used in combination with open software (where bosses look for talent) and venues to spread/show your talent (the open software community) so people can see your purple cow.

Purpose: [#EW] Most people don't really have a purpose, they drift through life, pushed and pulled by events and advertisements, not spending enough energy anywhere to make a difference or make a contribution to society. No achievements can come without sufficient focus. [#Watt191] Ask yourself whether you should study something, what your purpose in it is. Who will benefit? [#Persxv] Unity of purpose is important for achieving our goals. [#Loeh133] A sense of purpose and values is the essential start for a successful life. [#SellHuman217] Consequences for vulnerable group helped more with soap dispensers than consequences for self. Also stories of helped alumni fired up fundraisers. [#Greene180] If you go at your work with half a heart, it will show in the lackluster results and in the laggard way in which you reach the end. [#NS250616FutureOfWork] People with a sense of purpose live longer, perhaps due to having reasons to adapt a healthier lifestyle, or because a sense of meaning helps with stress, seeing them as challenges instead of setbacks.

Purpose of science: [#SanderDekkerOpeningAcademischJaarLeiden2014] Science should not be a goal of itself [scientists may disagree, though], but to improve society. Scientists should communicate their findings to the public. Likes Ilonka Smeets and such

Purpose-Truth-Action: [#Loeh15] First start with a purpose, then face the truth of where you are now, and then take action to get where you want to get.

Purposeful: [#John158] Purposeful does not mean that surprises in your course towards your purpose cannot happen, but that you cannot be easily deflected from your goal.

Pushing: [#Coyl188] Expert teachers push immediately forward if a student reaches a level, even if the student is not entirely comfortable on that level yet.

Puzzle: [#Coyl17] If you have to think about an observation (sh_e/sock) you remember it much better {attention-method?} [#Flourish55] Most academics solve puzzles, no problems.

Q: [#Imagine144] Ideal level of Q for musicals is around 2.6; lower gives too little trust, higher has too few novel ideas from 'outsiders'.

Quality: Does the intuition of 'quality' come natural and is practice only important to make one explicitly conscious of the 'good' characteristics? Probably the sense of quality is like most human skill: part of it will be innate (what is a beautiful woman? Sweet food being tasty) other things for which one cannot or does not have to evolve can be learned, such as assessing the 'quality' of a chess move. In that case, quality, like learning, is the result of repeated exposure and feedback. Even then, in the beginning at least it develops an intuition (which stack of cards is best) which can perhaps only be made conscious with much thinking and experimenting and explicit instruction. [#Eyse139] Quality of work correlates with quantity, but the quantity doesn't explain all of it. {original contributions?} {feeling of beauty?} [#Care] Noting down your own main quality and why it is important can enhance self-confidence and therefore prestations (even on school) – this method does not profit people with enough self-confidence already, however.

Quantification: [#Med18] Quantification is a useful technique to make headway in science.

Quantitative knowledge: [#EricB590] Also known as Gq, it's similar to Gc though it seems more involved in maths/calculation skill. One of the eight or so contributors to human ability/intelligence.

Quantity: [#Simo154] The quantity of output of scientists correlates quite well to their fame and chances of winning a Nobel Prize. It does not always work that way, but the exceptions are dis tributed quite normally around the line of correlation (matter of luck, probably). Geniuses don't produce “hit after hit”, but blunder often too

Questioning attitude: [#Adams104] May be important for creativity. ('Why is...') Perhaps partially decreases in adulthood since it seems 'good to be smart' and 'bad to seem ignorant' [also, we totally obey authority, students listening intently to a talk that was in reality complete nonsense]. To the young, everything needs improvement. To the elder – happier with status quo? 'Constructive discontent'. Merely starting to ask questions may already help.

Questions: [#Coyl151] Where will YOU go to college? {EW: may work better since it encourages a mind to wonder on the mystery} [#Clar118] Questions can help sustain attention. First ask question, then pause, then call on someone to respond. Next to knowledge-questions, you can use experience-questions and opinion-questions ('How does this work in your company?/ What do you think?) [#Clar126] Questions during a text help learning, unless the learners are younger (like reading is not automated) and thereby take away cognitive resources. Questions help recall the questioned material better than the unquestioned material. [#Clar217] For learning, do not use close-ended factual-type questions; show sample and ask learners to connect sample to lesson contents, wait 3-5 seconds. Question, pause, call upon individual, or ask for show of hands, or let people find out answer in small group. If answer is hesistant but correct, affirm and explain why, if incorrect: hint, different question, re-explanation. [#Hatt7] Experts may sometimes ask as many questions as 'experienced' teachers, but they ask the questions which are more important for their lessons (such as ability, experience, and background of the students). [#Tigg122] Asking questions is better for helping people change than prescribing solutions. [#Edu] If students (for example, Chinese students) are afraid of questions, ask them simple questions first, like “what's your name?” [#Hatt28] Questions don't always work in class since students perceive it as just a tool for the teacher to control the lesson; the teacher already knows the answer. [#Hatt183] Good questioning can be trained; surface questions can help reinforce surface knowledge (if they're subject-related), deeper questions have a more general appeal. However, may not be the most powerful method of education. [#Will75] Teachers are often too eager to supply the answers, while the audience actually needs to learn to find the question interesting and important. [#SellHuman149] Trick: freewrite questions, change each statement into question, then change/remove close-ended questions. Www.rightquestion.org. [#Greene87] Hgow do things work, how do decisions get made, how does the group interact? [#EW] Why is this not a coincidence? (for example, why is Felix’ situation not a coincidence?)

Quick wins: [#Switch133] Quick wins are very important to get fired up and for example beat the debt snowball. 'You can't combat powerlessness with math – you combat it by showing people they can win.' Also known as 'small wins', 'inch pebbles', one way to shrink the change. [#Switch144] A small win reduces importance 'it's no big deal', reduces demands 'that's all that needs to be done' and raises perceived skill levels 'I can do at least that'. All three factors will make change easier and self-sustaining. Select small wins that are meaningful and are within immediate reach; if no goals fulfill both, choose the latter!

Quitting science: [#C2W12112011] Reasons to quit science: not to diminish your salary to that of a first year PhD-student (female researcher), liked ' arbeidsvoorwaarden' in industry, working in groups, and lack of competition. Another didn't care too much about details.

QWERTY-effect: [#NS300416QuirkyQWERTYEffectFoundAllOVerTheWeb] we have more positive associatios with words which consist of letters from the right side of the QWERTY keyboard.

Rabi, I: [#Hargit155] When found a derelict physics department and he couldn't recruit senior scientists, decided to begin developing our own young people and bringing in other young people (2 years, 8 Nobel-laureates to be worked there)

Racism: [#Sommers238] Prime-time TV characters act more coldly against black characters, and seeing them interact with black characters gives others also more difficulty pairing pleasant words with black names. [#241] Black names are discriminated against on resumes (system 1?), and interviewers sit closer to white interviewees and make fewer speech errors. Makes candidates seem more capable as well!

Raggedness: [#Weiner193] Is a certain raggedness necessary? (in singers or such)

Raising genius: [#Howe110] Many parents who try to stimulate their children as much as possible, achieve that their children become precocious, but in all too many cases their children will lack the practical social skills to become a full success. This may be because those children are not allowed to make their own decisions (and learn from their own mistakes), and lack the play activities that train social skills. Also children need physical next to mental exercise. Witte did that better. He also emphasized the language, as it very much amplifies a child's mental powers {precision, necessitating better observation}. The Wittes took care of giving their son the widest possible range of experiences. They also kept the teaching informal, and only let him read when he wanted to read. The Wieners had lots of intellectual contacts who rubbed off on the child, and fantastic access to books, they only failed in not allowing their child to make his own decisions.

Rally the herd: [#Switch187] If people know that other people dislike their behaviour (if they don't realize it yet), changes will come much faster.

Ramachandran, V.S.: [#Greene32] Ramachandran knew he was different from other boys his age; wasn't interested in sports, but loved to read about science. Father pressured him to enroll in medical school, soon Ramachandran began to read more than was required, including 'Eye and Brain', started to conduct own experiments which he got published. Got him invitation to come study visual neuroscience at Cambridge, but did not feel at home there; people worked as if it were simply a job. Soldiered on, finding his own interests in the department, and completed his degree. [#Greeene110] Found Cambridge a competitive, cuttthroat, almost corporate environment, professors and studens tended to treat science as a kind of nine-to-five job. But when professor who had written “Eye and Brain” visited Cambridge, flair for drama, great sense of humor. R. introduced himself, mentioned an experiment he had been pondering himself and was invited to Bristol; Gregory was precisely the kind of eccentric Ramachandran could identify himself with. [#210] At one point became fascinated with phantom limbs, and read everything on the subject. R's criteria for research: he had to be able to show that it was a real phenomenon (so no telepathy), it could be explained in terms of current science, and that it had important implications stretching beyond the confines of his own field.

Ramanujan: [#Eyse198] Mathematician who was extremely strong-willed and fully focused on maths.

Ramsay: [#Jaffe162] Discovered helium with his spectroscope [EW: one should know the tools of the trade!] Got into chemistry when he needed to stay at home for a soccer injury, and browsed a book on chemistry that described the preparation of gunpowder.

Random rate process: [#Kluw273] Learning may assume that something is a 'random rate process', in contrast to a normal distribution, a random rate only has one parameter, the rate. Predictions work quite well; increasing the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) proportionally to the intertrial interval (ITI) does not affect the number of trials needed to learn an association.

Random stimuli: [#Weng54] Either by looking at clouds, the flickering of flames, the circulation in your eyes, making a walk and gaze at random things, or use tarot cards, randomness helps us get new ideas and break habits of thoughts {as long as we do not focus too sharply on the problem}. [#Ster69] Randomly chosen parts produce a larger number of creative inventions.

Randomness: [#Clar73] Expert memory for random chessboards is worse than novice memory – would their knowledge interfere (more strongly activating existing/expected patterns than actual patterns?) [#Imagine172] Ogilvy always had some 'sure-fire' losing pitches; if one of them unexpectedly worked, he learned something very new about advertising.

Ranking: [#PISA/EW] If you want to incite competition, introduce a ranking.

Rapport: [#Who96] By having high rapport with an interviewee, you can get the most valuable data; polite interrrupting can build that rapport (positive emotion + summary).

RAS: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/radical-teaching/201005/want-children-pay-attention-make-their-brains-curious] Reticular Activating System, selects stimuli from the senses that will be processed by the rest of the brain. Priority is paying attention to threats, then very receptive to novelty or changes that arouse curiosity {EW: Bayesian brain?}

Rate of change: [# http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-campus/201109/how-fraternities-and-sororities-impact-students-or-do-they] It's better for a student to join a fraternity in the spring, as they've been able to adjust to academic life by then.

Rating: [#Whit60] Rating bodily sensations like tension or flowingness on a scale from 1 to 10 can help improve physical movement.

Ratio bias: [#NS120211] People judge odds greater if the absolute numbers increase; like 100 out of 1000 is seen as a greater chance than 10 out of 100.

Rationality: [#Nelissen17] We may have developed rationality for those circumstances that are rare enough to not make (evolved) emotions a reliable guide. Which included situations of high complexity, which are relatively common in societies.

Rationality Quotient (RQ): [#NS300313] measure of ability to transcend cognitive bias; depends mostly on metacognition, using tricks, like considering the opposite to your intuitive answer.

Ray, Brian: [#Robi115] Noticed at 3-year old how his half-sister and her friend looked at pop musicians, half-sister was enthousiastic about her own band work, and toured her half-brother over concerts.

Reactance: [#NS] People not doing what others want them too (strongest in young and males). Even works unconsciously – perhaps a defense against others trying to limit their freedom? Is strongest when people perceive the other/the rules as unfair. [#Influence246] Things that are harder to get actually become more desirable due to reactance. Parental interference can even fuel love (Romeo & Juliet). Banning something (like pornography) both leads to a greater desire for it and a more positive attitude towards it. [#Hooked120] Can be overcome (and compliance doubled) by adding the sentence “but you are free to accept or refuse”.

Reaction speed: While reaction speed seems to correlate with IQ, reaction speed in general does not seem to have much to do with reaction speed in particular situations one has trained for, as great table tennis player Desmond Douglas had slower 'natural reaction' speed than his manager – but was by far the best player of England!

Reactivation: [#More69] It's generally necessary to practice a bit again before applying a skill you haven't applied for a long time. [#EW/More] In theory, reactivation can be more efficient that just 'doing it', simply because you can choose to activate the right/needed modules.

Readiness: One of the four key adult learning principles (with experience, autonomy and action) (#Stol47). Readiness is enhanced by showing people how the material solves/avoids a problem for them, provides an opportunity or increased status, or allows personal/professional growth. <EW> Informally, readiness could be known as the “what's in it for me”-principle.

Reading: [#Watt41] Next to observation, one method of learning. Its great advantage is that it allows us to access the knowledge of many others, even of the dead and those who live in faraway lands. There are many books though, and a judicious friend or mentor who recommends a selection can be very helpful to concentrate ones effort in a productive way. Browsing a book one time first can be helpful, as is making notes in it and reviewing them after the first read. [#Bloo512] The future top scientists were read to a lot at home {EW: similar to young Delft student?} [#EricB290] Roe's study confirmed that most later scientist were inveterate readers, and most enjoyed school and studying. [#EricB397] Extensive reading is a powerful predictor of general knowledge (r=0,85), even after the effects of cognitive ability have been removed. Later writers read really much, and especially in their own genre. [#Hatt70] Teaching children specific reading strategies is much more effective (d=1.18) than listening to your children read (d=0.51) which is much more effective than reading to the child (d=0.18). The three pillars of successful reading are decoding, vocabulary and comprehension, and learning specific strategies and processes. Vocabulary helps a lot (d=0.97), giving definition and contextual information both are needed, as is deeper processing, and multiple exposures. Mnemonic keyword (see angling angel) helps, though mainly short term. Phonics instruction (learning to link letters with sounds) also works. Repeated reading programs (increasing comprehension and fluidity by reading a passage multiple times) also works. Synthesis of sounds with letters is one of the most powerful methods. Learning new words by just reading is often not effective, only 15% of unknown words is learned, and less if there is a high frequency of unknown words. Teachers reading to children (and interacting in dialogue) and parents reading to children help; volunteers reading to children not. Effects of just silent reading are low as well. The usefulness of parents/teachers reading to children diminishes as children become able to read on their own. [#Int?”Jong Gelezen] Mark Taylor, Oxford, found that children who read a lot more often become manager and/or go to university. Playing computer games diminished those chances. Sports, or visiting museum, concerts, cinema had no significant?} effect. [#Medawar8] Young Peter Medawar read a lot as a child. [though he was also afraid of the dark] Also Jules Verne, HG Wells, popular science books. [#Med17] Beginners in science must read, but intently and choosily and not too much. Medawar does not believe in training unless it's urgent [#Will46] Books, newspapers and magazines are especially effective of introducing new ideas and vocabulary to students. [#Foer141] Due to the lack of spaces and punctuation, reading in the early middle ages (before the 9th century) was done aloud, though some experts could read silently [not as illogical as it sounds, as speaking is without spaces either]. Indexes or page numbers, or tables with contents were not common either. After invention of the index, books became so much easier to consult that memorizing data was not that important anymore. [#NRC290911]JosVanBerkum: if you read a lot, you can more easily switch to the value patterns of another person. [#NRC270913] Girls like books about emotions, friendship, humor, being in love, scary stories, animals. Boys choose books with humor, scary stories, sports, war, fantasy, legends, men, swords, honor. Girls read to 'wegdromen' -to alleviate stress. Boys are in contrast looking for excitement. Girls read scary stories to learn how to cope with fear, boys read them for the story. Boys also like comics and non-fiction more. [#Jansen55] Faculty of 1000 biology, faculty of 1000 medicine etc. for the hottest papers in your field. And start with review papers first! Title, abstract, headers & figures. [and then decide if text is worth reading further]. Also has specific tips for journal club. [#http://www.intermediair.nl/carriere/doorgroeien/competenties/8-manieren-om-je-productiviteit-te-verhogen] You can speed up reading by only reading first and last sentences of paragraphs. [#http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2015/voorlezen-aan-temperamentvolle-babys-stimuleert-taalontwikkeling.html?utm_source=150512-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=voorlezen-aan-temperamentvolle-babys-stimuleert-taalontwikkeling&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Voorlezen (reading out aloud) to children stimulates their language development from age 8 months, especially for 'temperamental' babies, babies who cry easily. [#EW] Einstein gained four advantages from his self-study: 1: he kept his motivation high, 2: he was learning more relevant physics, 3: he learned faster and more than his fellow-students (reading on own speed), 4: he was exposed to and automatically learned to model the greatest scientists of his time. [#EW] Try wide reading? [also for SciTal] -read a lot, but also portion diversely.

Reading gap: [#NRC180313] While boys score better than girls in maths (in emancipated countries), girls almost everywhere score better than boys in reading [EW: stereotype threat versus better … property of girls]. Reading gap biggest for lowest-scoring boys and girls, maths gap biggest for best scoring boys, perhaps explainable by saying that reading skill easily reaches a plateau [EW: probably subjective test makers effects becoming more important than reading skill at higher levels]. How smaller the maths gap, the bigger the reading gap. [?] <Gijsbert Stoet>

Real work: [#Fors69] Real work is work that advances your business or your job. Other work (or work that you can and should delegate) is just 'busy work'. Note that real work also involves thinking and planning, this is crucial even though it might not look very 'busy'!

Real world applications: [#Hatt145] Stressing real world application of maths does not help learning; lots of feedback to the student, either from the teacher or from a peer group, however does.

Realism: [#EricB177] {Would realism in a memory also make it more believable? Such as the pope-kidnapping war?} [#Zill104] Media messages have the most impact if viewers perceive them as realistic.

Reality: [#NRC101211MarkElchardus] How we perceive reality and society is not primarily determined by our own observations, but by what teachers and media tell us. The media that are selected to watch are strongly determined by education. For a part because, while all students start with a preference for commercial programs, VWO-students go to read state programs (VRT) and 'good' newspapers. Lowly-educated are frustrated due to lack of respect for them, believe in 'mean world'

Reality distortion field: [#Isaacson150] People like Steve Jobs had a 'reality distortion field', being able to make people do things that they themselves had never believed possible. [#211] May be general property of entrepreneurs, possibly to motivate people.

Reason: [#Nass191] The 'because I need to make copies' works if you seem nice and reasonable enough.

Reason-based choice: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/everybody-is-stupid-except-you/201110/the-smartphone-marketplace-and-reason-based-choice] Choosing from three options, where two are similar, tends to pick the odd one [unless Dan Ariely-> one of the same things is clearly better]. We like to have a reason for our choices, else we pick something from a different category.

Reasonable: [#HaidtH70] Reading all materials before hearing one’s role makes people more reasonable (6%  vs 25% unnegotiable conflicts). Alternative: look for weaknesses in your case.

Reasoning: [#HaidtH65] Most people stop thinking as quickly as possible, as soon as they reach the “makes sense”-point.

Rebelliousness: [#Greene180] Choosing something that appeals to your sense of unconventionality and rebelliousness can help stir your emotions/motivation.

Recall: [#EricB547] Recall is immediate reproduction of something, retention is long-term remembering. [#Nati79] In the first learning of a word, the word and its translation can best be presented simultaneously. After that, recall (so pausing before seeing the translation and trying to come up with the word) works better. {EW: higher need?} [#RoadExcel16] Expert's recall is better, but seems to be mediated by patterns; if random subsequent chess positions do not match a pattern, memory worsens. {EW: and would they be more sensitive to interference from known patterns than novices?} [#Will56] With each recall trial, people remember more.

Receiving field theory: [#EW] Being inspired by someone is only possible if you have enough experience/neurons dedicated to the field to be tremendously stimulated by it. Someone who has never listened to music may not feel inspired to become a concert pianist. {But doesn't the Swedish pool player from 'The Element' seem to contradict this? Why do you postulate this theory in the first place? Well, in science people cannot get excited by what they cannot understand, that's clear. The lone person who didn't catch the piano bug until the concerto would be another argument; if there were people who had been inspired without any piano or music education, my theory would fail. But my inspiration for musical writing was probably only possible because of exposure to both musicals and a lot of writing, for musical participation by both singing lessons and my acting course).

Recepies: [#EW] In contrast/supplement for mental models. First because mental models can be much more complex than a recipe, secondly because recipes makes one avoid the search and creativity that is needed to distill a good solution from a mental model. Still, a mental model is a good failsafe for when a recipe fails to work.

Receptive training: [#Stol110] First of four training types, receptive training is essentially telling (the vessel approach). Has its (limited!) uses to create awareness, or if learners know a lot already or if they need be motivated. Use sparingly!

Receptive/productive: [#Nati31] Receptive learning is faster than productive learning, though productive learning is slightly more efficient for productive retrieval than receptive learning. If both directions are required, L1->L2 may be slightly more efficient than L2->L1. Hypothesis: 'receptive' word is new, only links to meaning; 'productive': L1 word has many associations already, L2-word may be rather weak aspect of it. Other hypothesis is that you need more knowledge for proper productive use.

Reciprocal inhibition: [#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wolpe] For muscles: tensing muscle A relaxes oppositie muscle B (what you do when you have cramps in your 'kuit'), in psychology: you can inhibit a response (fear) by simultaneously cultivating another emotion (like assertiveness, or joy).

Reciprocal teaching: [#Hatt204] Student and teacher take turns in 'being the teacher', students checking their own understanding of the material by generating questions and summarizing.Good effect (d=0.74), and even better if there is explicit teaching of cognitive strategies beforehand.

Reciprocity: [#Pers176] If someone has just turned down your request, you can usually ask them for something else. And if someone asks you something, YOU can ask something in return. [#Gold40] People tend to reciprocate kindness independent on whether they like you, the old networking adage of “whom can I help” is therefore extremely valid. Interesting strategy is to promise something to a friendly customer-service agent, for example, writing good letter of recommendation to the boss. Note that favour-doers attach more importance to their favour as time goes on, favour-receivers tend to devaluate favours over time. [#Influence21] Reciprocation trumps liking. If no favour has been given, liking influences what another will do for you. If a favour has been given: liking is unimportant. If liking does not work (you're too weird, and don't want to change, like Hare Krishna), go for small favours and reciprocation. Free samples also work via reciprocity, and are accepted more easily as a favour since there is a seemingly valid reason for giving it (“people can try out the product”). Note that there is not only an obligation to give back, there is also an obligation to receive in the first place: refusing someone flat out is impolite (perhaps because a small favour at first helps build friendships). A gift may not be answered by an attack or neglect {so can it prevent an attack?} but can invite a substantially larger favour in return. Return favour is often larger because 'giver' chooses both gift and return favour (unfair, of course), and because a feeling of obligation is very unpleasant, bigger than a greater return gift, next to the risk of external/social shame if we give back too little. Note that there is also concession obligation: if someone makes a concession to us, we're obliged to make a concession to them (no ticket for $5? Then buy a chocolate bar for $2), though the first request cannot be too extreme, then person does not seem to be in good faith. With sales this works that if you refuse, the other can ask for referrals. Works through both reciprocity and perceptual contrast (second favour looks smaller). [a new outsider can judge a later 'concessed' version more accurately, as in Watergate, since he does not suffer from the reciprocity rule). For the asker, asking too much is almost always good: either gets it, or concession. Much more likely to get 5 dollar when asking for 10 dollar first than for asking 5 dollar at the outset. Also has advantage that other person will feel more responsible for the result, after all, he/she 'produced' the concession AND also feel more satisfaction (so more likely to respond to future requests). Are we helpless? Well, you can accept favours, but if you recognize something as a trick, you're free to do as you want. The rule states that you have to repay favours with favours, but not that you have to repay tricks with favours. And remember, if justice is to be done, exploitation attempts should be met with exploitation. [#Nass187] “I'm from New Yersey, where are you from?” makes people much more likely to reveal information. People also liked the 'disclosive' computer more. [#HaidtH57] Also in relationships: need good balance of gifts, favors, attention and self-disclosure.

Recognition: [#EricB408] Most people only start analyzing when they lack recognition of a situation. {EW: similar to backtracking of inventivity}

Recognition heuristic: [#NS121111] Choosing a familiar option when there is very little information to go on.

Recommitting: [#Lyubom290] Oprah recommits every day to her goals.

Reconsolidation: [#Medi127] Some scientists think that a memory when retrieved needs to be reconsolidated as it has been returned to its unstable form. During this process it can also possibly be adapted or deleted.

Reconstruction: [#EW/Supermemo] It could be that chess grandmasters remember positions by remembering opportunities and threats next to some information on typical matches or end games; those pieces of information can help reconstruct the chess board, even if the actual positions of the pieces are not saved like in an array, and by elaborate encoding with information redundancy, the system should be relatively robust to slight errors (which would probably give weaker signals anyway)

Records: [#Colv9] Records keep getting broken, not because people nowadays have better genes or are healthier {EW: though better health and more possible contestants may help} but because training methods improve.

Recovery: [#Loeh12] Time spent in recovery is not weakness, but an integral part of sustained performance. Top tennis players have effective recovery routines between points. [#Redirect56] People recover from bad news (like having the Huntington gene) in about 6 months; uncertainty however increases depression over time. People who can make sense of the loss of a loved one (religious beliefs?) also recover faster.

Recurrent neural network: Neural network in which neurons in say the middle layer are also connected with each other, and possible with themselves, being able to 'store state', so also be able to stimulated by the other neurons in the next phase (so kind of memory?). “Long-Short term memory model” by Hochreiter, which has 'memory cells' instead of neurons, but works very well.

Recursion: [#Laird7] {EW} Is recursion important for the human mind?

Redefining ones domain: [#EricB785] Some people redefined their domain (the Wright brothers, Calder, Beethoven) while others did not (Edison's lightbulb, Watson and Crick, Mozart). {EW: might the difference be that the redefiners fused separate knowledges from diverse (sub)disciplines?}

Rees, Martin: [#NS170207] Was not sure about his choice to do a PhD until one year into his PhD.

Refactoring: [#EWL070712] If you refactor, the number of elements you have to deal with decreases, by removing extraneous elements you can get a flash of insight. [like computers versus Kepler]

Reference specification: [#Nati50] Contrasts to sense-selection; keeping an abstract idea of a word into memory (fork meaning fork-shaped) and then applying it to the context where the word is used, rather than selecting the meaning from alternative concrete options in memory. Different languages use different abstractions- in Indonesian, a fork is mainly seen as an eating tool, not a shape. Learning words with reference-specification could in theory greatly help learning.

Refining: [#Seth125] Ideas, like Planck's quantum mechanics, do not get born completed, like Athena in her armor, they often shape themselves over months and years, being extended, refined and modified through deeper study and external criticisms.

Reflection: [#Watt98] It is always useful to reflect after having had a conversation, also remark who was pleasant to hear and who behaved poorly, and why. [#Pino149] Reflecting on your life with some regularity is good. [#Meda58] There is no such thing as 'time needed for reflection', as the mind returns to it's zero-point of thinking about research if one is interested enough [EW: but daily worries?] [#Imagine5] Bob Dylan spent a week in bed with a food poisoning, giving himself ample time for reflection and realizing that he was drained.

Reflectivity/Impulsivity: [#http://social.jrank.org/pages/148/Cognitive-Style-Reflectivity-Impulsivity.html] Reflective people think slower but make fewer errors; impulsive people do the reverse and have greater trouble with delay of gratification (and therefore tend to do less well in school, despite similar IQs) Reflective students are also more accurate in identifying the parts of a whole. Students shift in the spectrum somewhat over a schoolyear depending on the reflectivity/impulsivity of their teacher. {EW: may reflective people monitor results more closely, to ensure that they are really seeing and not making snap judgments?}

Reformation: [#Imagine218] The reformation encouraged the masses to read, and thereby also opened a market for books.

Reformulating: [#Watt247] A good teacher can reformulate things so that the learners may understand it more clearly.

Reframing: [#Syed105] The right words at the right time can transform one's beliefs “Later doesn't always come for everybody” [#Switch174] 4 grades, A, B, C, and NY ('not yet') transformed a school. [#EW/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shyness-is-nice/201110/spoiler-alerts-the-necessity-uncertainty] If the right words can make a situation seem/feel different, that means we could use 'reframing' therapy against our own destructive habits. [#EW/Schafer61] example “There is no challenge without a reward” [#HaidtH25] Point to the things that you have left (like Boethius wife and sons), see the positive things in the negative (adversity makes one stronger), negative things in the positive (wealth brings greed), and minimize discomfort (see how small this is compared to the universe)

Reggio-schools: [#Robi233] Schools in which much art is given and the lessons are centered around the children's interests.

Regression: [#Eyse15] Genius may not be very heriditary, since all heriditable properties have a tendency to regress to the mean – most parents (and offspring!) of very bright people are likely to be 'just bright' or average people, if you only look at the nature-component. {nurture could stabilize things a bit} No records show genius begetting genius, probably for this reason.

Regression-to-the-mean: [#EricB150] If a test is unreliable, very high scorers in the first sampling will have more average scores in the next sampling (low scorers also go to average). That does not mean that training levels skill, just that your measurement is not very accurate.

Regret: [#NRC090611] Anticipating regret makes people choose different actions. [#NS200816PlayYourCardsRight] Poker players don't maximize gains, they minimize regret (expected payoff of play minus potential payoff of different choice). Algorithms based on regret are best at predicting human behaviour.

Regulatory theory of talent: [#EW] Like a biological network, talent factors can strengthen or weaken one another: people can strengthen or weaken your resolve, dead-end projects can detract you from success, results can increase your knowledge.

Rehearsal: [#Kluw121] Rehearsal in working memory is simple rehearsal for words, and paying attention to a specific location for spatial memory tasks.

Reinforcement: [#Bloo483] Young pianists were tremendously praised and received attention by parents, family and peers for playing the piano. [#Ster78] Reinforcing children creating new or diverse forms did indeed increase their creativity. [#Tigg145] Every behaviour that occurs regularly occurs because of some form of reinforcement (positive or negative) Positive reinforcement: something pleasant occurs after doing something, negative reinforcement: not doing something causes something unpleasant to occur.

Reinforcement schedule: [#Mill80/EW] A pleasure, to remain pleasurable, such as music, must either be changed from time to time by novelty, or made unfamiliar again by pauses.

Reinstatement: [#NS281115ShadowsOfThePast] During remembering, the same brain regions are activated as were activated while forming the memories in the first place.

Rejection: [#Weiner60] Rejection can drive creativity, especially when the subject of rejection is an independent person (EW: would any kind of uncertainty, especially about the strength of one's social relationships, drive achievement?).

Relapse: [#Tigg226] Every change process can have moments of relapse. If the relapses are rare, you should just prepare for those situations better. If they are frequent, you should more critically study why the relapse occurs, and try to move some of the rewards of the original behaviour to the new behaviour. Finally, one may relapse because there seems to be lack of results, either because the behaviour has been chosen incorrectly, or executed incorrectly. Analyze then and improve! After a relapse, starting up the correct behaviour should happen as thorougly as at the start!

Relational sets: [#HayesS21] We can link any two symbols with each other, and easily create contrasts and triangles, before-after, cause-effect, near-far, comparative-evaluative; happiness can remind us of sadness.

Relationships: [#Medi45] The quality of learning (and performance) may depend to quite an extent on the relationship between student and teacher; the person needs to feel safe. [#Greene192] You may want to focus not only on the parts, but also on the relationships between parts to get a good view of a system. [#Patter206] Actions that occur less than 2% of time (like the colonoscopy) can color the other 98%. [#Schmid199] “Three week rule: first three weeks on a job, do not do anything. Listen to people, understand their issues and priorities, get to know and care about them (including partner’s and kid’s names), and earn their trust. And make people smile, especially don’t hold back deserved praise.

Relativation: [#Syed183] “It's only speed skating” - people with a tendency to choke need a motivational double-think; train as if something is the most important thing in your life, but relax and relativate the importance just before the game. Some players do not need this as they are better at keeping out fear and doubt, but it can be a useful tactic.

Relatives: [#HaidtH48] Our kinship-protection system is still active, so that even in Western society we tend to call others “tante Carrie”. Also why the Godfather is the Godfather. Forging kin-like links with non-kin.

Relaxation: [#Pers275] Top tennis players relax much better between points than the non-top. [#Loeh97] Also a pause helps a painter (or writer) judge his own work better. [#Peale76] Physical relaxation helps against emotional tension/anger/distress. [#Hatt53] Relaxation, and especially progressive relaxation, has a small positive effect on school performance. [#Higbee66] Relaxation of mind (through meditation, for example) and of body (relaxation) is useful; elderly people applied a mnemonic technique more effectively after relaxation, and sporters also use relaxation to focus on the critical aspects of performance. [#NS110513SayOmmTOKEepYourGenesHealthy

Relevance: [#Ster143] Creative people may be less able to distinguish relevant from less relevant stimuli (also called 'overinclusive thinking' or 'wide associative horizons'). [#Pink15] All of us must sort out the relevant facts about a situation from a great mess of irrelevant ones, like the colour of the walls. This is an amazing feat of 'common sense.'

Reliability: [#EricB148] How reproducible a measurement is (of for example, running speed or intelligence). Often done by repeating the test later, but with more cognitive tests learning can take place in the mean time, using an alternate form is better then. Sometimes judgement is subjective, then you'd need to determine inter-observer reliability. All reliability is taken as rank-ordering, not absolute scores, by the way. {in contrast to natural science, where rank ordering is less important than absolute measures} [#Grin] “Betrouwbaarheid” according to Wim van de Grind is that the answers to pairs of questions, which sample the same contents but are phrased slighly differently, should be highly correlated.

Religions: [#Sidis] Imbuing children with a great fear of hell can be rather counterproductive to happy living and mental health later in life. [#Eyse130] Having the prtestant or Jewish religion makes one more likely to succeed – more family pressure to be successful? Note that Jewish children have on average higher intelligence than non-Jewish children (genes or more pressure?). [#Redirect52] Religion only makes you happier if you truly believe and your close ones share your belief. [#NS191209] Religion may be based on memory: episodic memory (tyraumatic, rare events that invite elaborate processing) – imaginistic religions and semantic memory (facts etc.) - doctrinal religions. The second type tends to spread more easily. Exclusivity vs orthodoxy (high arousal can give own interpretation?). Feel-good events like christmas are probably not processed as elaborately as traumatic events are. [#Strien279] Eminent scientists generally don't spend that much time on religion or are neutral agnostic. However, Jews and certain protestant sects (quakers, methodists etc.) are very much represented – the puritan ethos of those groups may be the most important. This may not go for Chinese [EW: they work hard, but may have their material goals too firmly in mind] [#Lyubom239] Being religious may help happiness. [#Hofste17] Religions do less to influence culture, they are more assimilating and extolling the culture’s previous values.

Remembering: [#Wolt53] Remembering something stores the same thing again, and also activates the knowledge, reducing the chance of finding competing knowledge (wrong-track phenomenon) – waiting a while helps a bit then. {so intermediate blocking again – would psychoticism do that less and therefore give more memories, even inappropriate ones? Similar to hallucinations by lack of afference?} [#Kluw216] Would remembering be similar to attention, with the same pitfalls and computational demands (weeding out irrelevant objects from the relevant ones?). A sort of filter, as insect r_ fails also if the second member of ordeal-roach is suppressed?

Repetition: [#Watt19] Repetition (sometimes in slightly different ways) is a key component of learning. [#Wolt27] May restart the consolidation process catalyzed by the hippocampus. {EW may be a biological mechanism to prevent overfitting}One of the major learning methods, repetition aims to strengthen certain concepts or associations in memory by giving several “doses” over time. While some brains may need less of a certain repetition than other brains (fast learners), in general it is advised to repeat an item after an hour, a day, a week, a month and half a year [#Buzan]. [#Stol102] The fifth of six cognitive strategies. SQ3R is for example very effective. [#More49] Start by clearing your mind, with a few deep breaths, for example, for you should be able to focus entirely on the practice. [#Nati110] Computerized rehearsal methods assuming that not all items are of equal difficulty, but base repetition on performance, work best. But deep processing and processing in context is always good for repetition. [#Higbee63] Even reading a morning prayer over 5000 times did not allow prof Edmund Sanford to recite it from memory. [#Higbee64] Rereading technical material helps readers to see the main framework, increasing problem-solving skill and the ability to transfer knowledge.

Repetition suppression: [#Kluw166] some neurons in temporal areas show reduced responses during stimulus repetitions {so may determine which signals are 'new', and have to be paid attention to, even as priming takes place so neurons may be more easily activated}

Representation: [#Zill250] People automatically look at the meaning of something, and see and distinguish it more easily than style or aesthetics (and prefer works that refer to everyday life and invoke warm feelings). Experienced viewers however pay more attention to style. The way in which data/information is represented greatly impacts learning. For route descriptions, maps are often superior than verbal descriptions, for example, and loose facts or numbers work better when incorporated into a story or a song. [#Adams4] Some representations make solving a particular problem easy (visualisation in the monk path problem), others make it hard or impossible (verbalisation) – more or less time has to be spent on finding a solution.

Representation structure: [#EricB531] Representation structure may depend on circumstances, at the very least it seems to differ between regular chess laying where one can perceive the pieces, and blindfolded chess where one can't.

Reputation: [#Eyse19] Reputation is a very subjective but necessary part of the definition of genius. Reputation measurements are usually however quite stable over time {after the genius has been dead long enough; the estimate of people's contemporaries is often way more off any stable mark than that of posterity} and seem rather consistent with each other in results, r=0.94 for scientists, for example. Reputation as a genius is however also skewed by irrelevant factors as dying young, having a handicap, being mad, unorthodox or prosecuted {EW: story techniques}.

Research seminar: [#Hargit129] Important influence on young scientists; introduces them to new fields, outside scientists with different styles and approaches, and teaches how to conduct scientific discussions.

Resentment: [Peal52] Praying for people you do not like or who have mistreated you can diminish resentment which gives a kind of spiritual blockade.

Residual activation: [#EW/EricB280] After you give an answer, you're more likely to give the same answer on the next problem when you're hurried (7x8=56, 7x9=56). [#EricB542] Residual activation may also explain why the ambiguity of SFs digit memorization 89,6 “a very old man” worked despite it being ambiguous – the memory may just jolt back the right number in preference.

Resilience: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/special-education/201102/praising-kids-is-not-enough] Children are more resilient when in a close, connected relationship with a stable adult. [#Flourish157] Resilience (brief period of depression + anxiety after a traumatic event) followed by a return to the previous level of functioning or even above, is much more common than PTSD (Post-traumatic growth).

Resistance: [#Fors7] Resistance is what happens if the reactive brain sees something as a threat. [#NS100508] If people resist an argument, the better the argument is, the more entrenched they become in their own opinions. For persuasion it therefore works better to start at a position similar to your audience and move slowly from there, and/or boost their self-esteem in the beginning, which makes them less resisting. [#ForsD8] Investigating WHY you resist something can yield valuable information. [#HeaB15] What looks like resistance is often lack of clarity, lack of concrete actions.

Resistance to ambiguity: [#NS300313] The temptation to accept the first solution to a problem even if it is obviously not the best.

Resistance to change: [#EW/Ster318] Would having fewer domains, and/or more integrated domains inhibit innovation since more people needed to accept it and part with their old ways?

Resolutions: [#Pers56] People typically make start resolutions (to start doing something) or stop resolutions. Interestingly, women are better at following up on start resolutions, men on stop resolutions. [#Scho43] Keeping resolutions, even small ones only to yourself, is good as it conditions your mind to finish what you start despite setbacks and adverse circumstances. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200912/the-joy-new-years-resolutions] Making resolutions (instead of keeping them) may be the most important part for most people, as it gives them a lift in mood and self-esteem and gives them a feeling of self-control.

Resources: [#Robi176] Wiley Pittman had a cafe next to the house of little Ray Charles. Ray was entranced by the music, and went in and listened, and Wiley taught him. [#Csik30] If a society invests many resources in an area (like the Florence bankers did for art during the Renaissance), young people will flock to that field.

Respect: [#Hatt8] Expert teachers have more respect for students, and demonstrate care and commitment for them. [#Greene300] Everett developed more respect for the Piranha when he saw them exercising their greatest strength, manoevering the jungle. [#Stalla65] Be respectful of other people: don’t interrupt them, ignore them, give them the silent treatment, do not berate them, rejecting other’s ideas without dialogue.

Responding: [#Seligm50] Practice active constructive responding: when someone else reports something positive/happy happening to them, ask them questions to help them relive the event. If that is hard, practice in the evening by reliving the event and writing down how you could have responded better.

Response: [#Stol65] Fourth learning principle. The more learners actually respond to the content (answering questions), the better they learn. It does not matter if the response is in their heads or on paper/out loud, it DOES matter however that the response is a meaningful one/be relevant to the learning material.

Response prevention: [#Burn360] Response prevention is a method for overcoming fear. If you feel anxiety overwhelming you (say that you feel you need to check whether you locked your bicycle), sit down and do nothing, and wait till the fear diminishes.

Responsibility: [#EW] If people don't have a choice in what they do or how they should do it, they feel generally less responsible for doing it {EW: why? Perhaps because then they don't need to think of reasons why they would do it, and do it well?} Employers and teachers telling people what to do diminish responsibility and enthousiasm in their subordinates. [#Colv119] Great performers also take responsibility for their performance; they don't blame the weather etc. for their errors. [#Pers137] One of the most motivating things about jobs – people must feel that what they do actually matters, and also have some freedom in how they perform the task. Spreading responsibility for a decision over more people is politically handy since you won't be the only one to be blamed. [#Whit28] Asking questions like “who wants to do this?”, and “what are you unsure of? What obstacles do you see?”, “when can you have it ready” helps. If people are responsibility shy, ask them about their fears, and whether they'd like to try some responsibility for a week. [#Gawan137] Dispersing responsibility is important, both cognitively and socially. In aviation it is usually the 'pilot not flying' who starts the checklist, as the 'pilot flying' is distracted too much by other things. So a surgeon should not be the checklist leader.

Restricting access: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200911/the-problem-dieting-0] Restricting access to something causes stress, which may trigger addiction.

Restrictiveness: [#NS080717ShouldWe…/ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127173] Jesse Harrington found that highly restrictive and permissive societies fared worse in measures of overall happiness, depression and suicide. (though the relationship is not extremely strong, and poor nations are more extreme in restrictiveness and permissiveness anyway; and no clear relationship with UAI and such. Seems more related to historical threats (hunger, invaders, earthquakes). Tightness more related to C, looseness to O.

Results: [#Med17] Getting results is motivating

Resume: [#C2W081113] Young scientists applying for a tenure track at Groningen university need at least a PhD, experience in education, 5 peer-reviewed publications, provable organisatorial abilities and excellent communicative abilities and two or more successful years as a postdoc in a foreign research institute.

Retarded students: [#Hatt125] 'Retarded' students often have deficits in specific brain functions, mostly those involving short-term memory. Note though that the difference in achievement between those students and the students with family/cultural problems is relatively small (d=0.10). And that labeling will give funding, but generally does not lead to more effective teaching.

Retelling: [#Nati136] Retelling increases vocabulary, especially when used generatively (text is absent) {EW: but would retelling, rereading, retelling work even better?}

Retention: [#Hatt99] Retention of students (let them repeat a year) has profoundly negative effects, greatly increases drop-out rates, and should probably be abolished at schools.

Retrieval practice: [#Schm212] All processes which cause learners to deactivate/'forget' their stable set and learn anew (with possibly different links?) enhance retention. The longer the interval between learning and test, and using recall instead of recognition, the greater the effect of retrieval practice seems to be.

Retrieval strength: [#Wyner31] Would retrieval strength correspond to the number of pathways throughout the brain ([#EW] or also with myelination? Or #connection?)

Retrieval structure: [#EricB547] next to meaningful encoding and speed-up, retrieval structure is one of the three principles for skilled memory. One example is the method of loci.

Reverberating loop: [#Kluw260] A reverberating loop can store data – but at continous, high energy cost. {EW: might be 'original' memory storage mechanism, though, and is still present in the ensembles/coordinated neuron firing; might have given rise to changes if the right chemicals are also present in the environment}

Reverse-engineering behaviour: [#Pink38] Reverse-engineering behaviour starts with a goal in mind, and the environment/beliefs in which that goal must be attained.

Reviews: [#Schmid189] It can help to review yourself, at least once a year. Would you work for you (or would you hire you?) Ideally, share it with people who work with you, will produce more/better feedback. [#Stalla59] Before going to bed? What have I done today to make myself a better man, how have I made this a better ship?

Revolutions: [#Strien180] Scientific revolutions are generally only seen in retrospect, and only when comparing start and end points that are rather far away (100 years or more). For scientists and such, the change seems much more gradual. Not necessarily because old opponents die; Lavoisier took 5 years to be sure himself of the oxygenation theory, but was able to convince almost everyone in the field within 15 years, even old adherents to the phlogiston theory. Einstein and Newton recognized the new gestalt at a time that others didn't see it yet or lacked courage. [And also needed enough energy/charisma/connections to convince the rest of the world!] [#194] Social changes <at least in the relevant segment of the population![#204]> can also affect science (different education etc., but also causing different viewpoints?) [#206] Without 'sounding board', an ideology will peter out and die (no attention/rewards anymore).

Revulsion: [#GrahamDavey] Revulsion correlates to fear of spiders and such – is often confused with fear.

Reward satiation: [#EW] It may be possible to get blunted or addicted if you are rewarded/experience positive emotions all the time (like when playing too many computer games). Possibly reward-less 'rest periods' can help, similar to how good movies have 'resting moments'

Reward system: [#McGon111] is not the same as the pleasure center; activates when people expect a reward is along the corner. “Do this again! This will make you feel good!”

Rewriting: [#Colv27] Mozart also spent lots of time correcting and rewriting, or putting aside pieces for months of years, working on them later. [#Parr90] Rewriting one's college notes is seldom useful; clarifying and structuring them, however, can be.

Rezo syndrome: [#EWL260614] Like Rezo the red priest in Slayers who tried to find a cure for his blindness but did not trouble to find out what caused his blindness in the first place, the phenomenon to propose and try out solutions without proper investigation of the problem. [bit similar to trial-and-error debugging]

RF: [#Kluw39] Receptive Field.

RFT: [#HayesS] Relational Frame Theory

Rhyme: [#Watt162] Rhyme is a very useful tool to stamp something more strongly in memory.

Rhythm: [#EricB539] Next to imagery and formulaic descriptions, rhythm is a useful tool to get something in memory.

RIASEC: [#EricB158] Holland's six vocational interest themes model. May inform one of suitable occupations, but does not predict excellence.

Rice, Tim: [#WhatACircus] Met ALW as book publisher gave him his name [Rice indicated that he liked writing songs – openness & contacts] ALW had the largest collection of records TR had ever seen. TR wanted to be a pop star (women, money and fame), didn't see, incredulous to him as plenty of blokes of his age with much less talent were making it. Still not life or death to TR (as they were to ALW). TR had some evidence of his capability, though it may have been TR's looks and general demeanour that sealed the deal for ALW. TR thought he got the better end of the deal 'you'd be mad to refuse being a sidekick to someone who would take the musical world by storm'. Kept an eye on the Melody Maker paper for ads asking for a vocalist, was not great singer, though [limitations of his voice?]. ALW extremely cultured for a teenager, discussing 'Good Food Guides' and Victorian architecture.TR was not fired by a musical about a squaky-clean philantropist {motivation/attention}. TR faked illness to skip a day at the solicitor's office to write lyrics {determination}. Very good academic achievements from an early age, but often bored when things got too easy. Was too insightful to join stupid rebellions or ideas and most often deduced that his parents were right. Was fascinated by numbers from an early age, writing 1...28 on birthday card for mother. Learned many statistics and names of planets by heart. Stared for hours at contraption of planets [absorption?] Wrote letter that he wanted to have the solar system model as it was to be discarded. “Saturn is 75,000 miles in diameter”Wrote multiplication tables on large stretches of unused wallpaper. Father Rice was an orphan, Tim himself not. Father was middle-class, intelligent, but lacked or rejected a 'killer instinct'. Neither parent handled money very well, though. Father was planespotter, passion for aeroplanes. Maternal grandfather businessman of very changing fortunes (smart, but not careful, from one scheme to the next). Mother once aimed to become a writer. Father kept diary. Father was also avid newspaper reader, and both parents encouraged reading enormously in Tim. Tim loved numbers, but was no mechanical prodigy [clumsiness?] Parents were not very musical, but house was full of books.

Right hemisphere: [#Imagine8] Damage to right hemisphere leads to inability to understand jokes, sarcasm or metaphors, using maps or making sense of paintings.

Right time- right place: [#SimonB185] Scientific and artistic geniuses depend more on dispositional variables (the right character and such), while military and political geniuses depend more on the right time and place. For example, vice presidents are not worse leaders than normal presidents, but they struggle much more with congress since they lack legitimacy (a bit like a substitute teacher). And inflexible presidents and flexible presidents flourish in different times.

Rigidity: [#Greene143] People become highly defensive if their ways are called into question; outwardly remain deferent to other's need for order, on your own try to retain your open spirit, let go of bad habits and deliberately cultivate new ideas.

Rigor: is there a tradeoff between rigor and relevance in research?

Rikers, Remy: [#AD210810] Professor of educational and development psychology, Rotterdam, also talent-basher.

Ringold, Faith: [#Robi62] Mother took her to listen to greats of music, like Billie Holliday, and was a kind of artist herself (fashion designer).

Ripeness: [#Eyse45] Newton failed in alchemy because the field was not yet 'ripe' for a grand unification. {lots of gaps – infinite possibilities}

Rising performance: [#Colv10] Clear in sports, music, learning (calculus, at least?) and chess, where champions of yesterday would be considered at merely master level today.

Risk factor: [#Eyse125] Risk factors correlate with a phenomenon, but in most cases one cannot be sure if they are truly causes, which by definition are necessary and sufficient for something to occur. Note the difference between 'risk factors' and 'causes' of genius!

Risk intelligence: [#NS190512] Risk intelligence (from professional gamblers) tends to spill over on the rest of their lives; more modestly, less likely to be overconfident.

Risk taking: [#Ster8] Risk taking seems to be correlated to creativity. [#Rost105] Critically acclaimed scientists enjoyed taking risk in their work much more than the merely competent scientists, though it should be noted that 70% of the competent ones were over 45, 80% of the acclaimed ones under 45!. [#Hargit92] One chemist made an almost quantitative estimate of the available information, to see if it was sufficient to take the next step. [#NS110415] Seeing a hot rival (or imaginging wooing a woman) makes men more willing to make risky decisions.

Risks: [#NS131110] People act on genetic information based on whether a particular risk is above or below average, not on basis of absolute values. [#McGon64] People are more willing to take any kind of risk when they are hungry (or do any kind of impulsive behavior and short-term thinking) [#Catmul142] Taking a risk necessitates a willingness to deal with the mess created by the risk. [#319] Management’s job is not to prevent risks, but to make it safe to take them.

Rituals: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/201108/parenting-four-sure-fire-ways-send-messages-your-children] Rituals give stability and a sense of security, but should be replaced when they grow stale. [#NS191209] Rituals give meaning, motivation and memory, three elements that help strengthen religion. By their nature puzzling activities that invite interpretation. [#Loehrs165] Rituals need to be adjusted to keep them challenging (like workouts) or meaningful (like hedonistic adaptation). May give more renewal if they are more scheduled and systemized? Need connection to deeply-held values. [#EW] Would work like tea ceremony: flow to reenergize? Or lower arousal? (like fun activities heighten arousal/make mood more positive?). Relation to meaning may be that it only works if you automatically pay full attention – being bored and having to force your attention undermines the relaxation effect.

Roach, Freddie: [#Greene38] Started training extra hard after his mother had told him that he couldn't fight (and that the elder brother was her favorite – so may have been fight for mother's attention – sibling rivalry).

Roadtrip nation: [#Newport11] May be interesting resource on passionate/successful people.

Rockefeller: [#Colv33] Had stated intention to become rich, and worked hard at everything.

Rockefeller institute: [#Hargit142] Spent lots of attention to how people wrote reports, John Maddox worked there for a while.

Role models: [#Colv197] If your father/parent works at something, or someone you admire does something, it is natural for a young child to want to do that too (the drawing 'talent' Yani, for example, whose father was an artist, and whom she could work next to). [#Coyl98] Perhaps it can also be called “if she can do it, why can't I”-phenomenon {EW: but I think it's less jealousy than seeing it is possible and desirable} Also works indirectly, if the whole family is a fan of Roger Federer.. Chick Murry for comedian Billy Connolly. Russell Simmons for Jay-Z. [#Ster122] Having multiple and diverse role models/mentors seems best {Love-law?}. [#EW] Having role models may help you absorb their (more successful) mindsets than you'd encounter with your parents and teachers. Role models may say something about what you think important. [#GladT?] If other people do it, or especially if high status other people who are comparable to you in some respects do it, it also functions as role modeling. It shows 'value', even if it is smoking. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201001/you-are-what-you-eat] inverse role models: when undergraduates hear that a behaviour is associated with graduate students, they diminish it, as undergrads don't want to be mistaken for graduate students [#EW: is it age or lack of status or coolness?] Or is that the default status of an out-group, and no further explanation is needed? Or would it be stronger if two groups are otherwise very similar and hard to distinguish? [#Strien285] The Curie-effect: fraction of graduating physicists who are female are 36%, 30%, 10% and 5% in Poland, France, Germany and the Netherlands respectively. [#CoyleT5] Even a brief connection with a role model helps increase unconscious motivation. (though must believe things like 'if he can do it, why can't I?' (62% longer on math tasks)You may try pictures or videos.

Roleplay: [#Nati138] Would roleplay answering questions about a text increase learning? {EW: possible negative effect from context, possible positive effect from motivation/deeper processing}

Romanticism: [#Hargit89] Szent-Gyorgii was not a romanticist in the lab: he dreamt of brain research, but merely enjoyed muscle research. Still, he did muscle research since the tools at his disposal would not allow him to reach truly important results. [#Leber] Would romantic be ‘surprise + delight?’ [EW: attention to detail, beauty also seem candidates]

Rommel, Erwin: [#Greene259] Had deeper knowledge than other generals on all the aspects of battle, constantly flew over the desert in his own plane. Was a trained mechanic, so had complete knowledge of tanks and what he could expect of them.S tudied in depth the psychology of the opposing army and its generals; continually interacted with his men so he knew how far he could push them.

Rostan: [#EricB429] Discovered that acclaimed scientists and artists spent more of their time finding problems than average.

Rote learning: [#CIAch3] Rote learning does not connect the new data to existing data; seems the least efficient learning technique there is.

Rothberg, Jonathan: American millionaire who gathered the DNA of 400 excellent mathematicians and theoretical physicsts, hoping to find the genetic basis of mathematical excellence. 'Project Einstein'

Rotmans, Jan: [#TransitieNL] Professor of transition, fascinated with societal change.

ROWE: [#PinkDrive86] Results-only work environment; you can be there when/whenever you want, as long as you get your tasks done. [#Newport113] Much better growth, and rate at which people leave plummets with 90%.

Rowling, J.K.: [#Burkeman178] Was an 'epic failure' 7 years after graduation (at least for a woman), so she focused all her energy on finishing the only work that mattered to her. (perhaps because she felt no need in having to 'prove' to others that she were successful?)

Rule activation: [#Medi86] The prefrontal cortex sends a double signal when it wants to start a job: a search signal for the relevant neurons, and an 'activation signal' to put them to work.

Rumination: [#Lyubom113] Against rumination – distract yourself. [EW: WoW was NOT a good idea]. [#119] Curiou or peaceful or amused or proud.

Rutherford, Ernest: [#Crop245] Rutherford regularly came into the laboratory to inquire how things went, paid attention to the smallest details, really interested in the work of everyone around him. [#Crop308] Thundering voice, not inclined towards modesty, liked to be admired, not afraid to be blunt. Was extremly ambitious and energetic (70 papers in 9 years), and drove his research team relentlessly. Had keen scientific intuition, quickly grasped the core of a problem, and made simple yet very elegant experiments. Usually gave his views on a scientific subject very briefly and with great clarity, but did not answer other viewpoints. Was a bit defensive against Snow, could be a bit secretive about his dark side or unfinished experiments {afraid of face loss?} Could call an assistant at 3 o clock in the morning if he 'felt it in his water'. Could yell things as 'Why don't you get a move on!' but seemed to care, never have contempt for clumsy experiments. People were free to choose their research, but after some time radiated towards Rutherford's ideas, because his intuition was so good. Rutherford was fourth of twelve children, mother was schoolmistress who stressed hard work as the remedy against all ills. Excellent student at school, but extraodinary talent in experimental science. Got scholarship, studied with J.J. Thomson in Cambridge, who was on the forefront of experimental physics. Was smart enough when getting his first professorship of enlisting a chemist (energetic, ambitious and broad-minded) to help with the chemical determinations. Later moved to the UK to be closer to the scientific centres of Europe. Was intrigued by the unexpected result of hard-scattering alpha particles, and decided to study it further. Later moved to Cambridge, the most prominent physics chair. His assistant Chadwick found the neutron, using a cue from strange experimental results reported by Joliot-Curie. Note that Rutherford sometimes did 'silly' experiments, which seemed silly since he could not explain the intricacies of his mind or intuition. Note that Rutherford had quite some tact, as he avoided political or religious (or scientific) controversies, and was able to set the disputes that arose amicably. Could show tact and kindness, and his research students were devoted to him. Found that if you couldn't explain a physical principle to a barmaid, the problem was with the principle, not with the barmaid. Could concentrate for very long periods on a problem without losing courage or enthusiasm 'I am sorry for the poor fellows who haven't labs to work in!' [#Jaffe212] Could not tire, was very handy but with a great imagination. JJ didn't like to send Rutherford away, but trusted that he would be able to work miracles in his own lab. Rutherford worked with almost equally brilliant, young researcher Soddy for two years. Was patient and broke hundreds of glass tubes trying to identify the nature of the alpha particles. [#Hargit137] Did not like his co-workers stay too late in the lab at night.

Ruud de Moor centrum: [#G&E250511] Centre that investigates quality of teaching, director Rob Martens. Indicates that Dutch teachers are decent teachers, but do too much alone; not informed about scientific developments, nor collaborating with colleagues.

S. [#Foer23]: check?} [#Higbee42] Whenever S. read a word, images cluttered his head, distracting from the text and making it hard to understand it.

Sacred: [#HaidtH193] Even nonrfeligious people will have ‘special’ places, events and books

Sacred values: [NS220912|PhilosophicalTransactionsOfTheRoyalSocietyBvol367p754] For sacred values, the brain regions for retrieving rules are activated, instead of the cost-benefit ones. Spending more time in rituals makes individuals consider both religious and non-religious values as sacred. Also the idea that ones group is under threat. Rituals may fuse our sense of self with group membership. Synchronized activity seems to help in that. Or rituals that produce feelings of shared suffering, pain and fear.

Sadness: [#Nass153] Sympathize with sad people, and emphasize the unavoidability of things. [#Nelissen87] Sadness increases the attention to the inner world. If one makes new plans, sadness melts away. Sadness makes the body weaker and more slow. However, activity also decreases sadness! Sadness and anger may also alternate, to keep the énergy level' of the body within reasonable parameters? Sadness may, as a function, also be a cry for help. It also helps bonding (as joy does?)

Safety: [#EricB592] Safe attachment to a primary caregiver may be important to develop Gc, as curiosity is only possible when one feels reasonably safe. Similar, such feelings of safety may extend to other social situations, for example in school, making children more enthousiastic, persistent and involved in classroom learning. [#Ster322] A 'safe' culture may be more resistant to innovations than a culture that suffers internal or external threats.

Salary: [#http://www.intermediair.nl/magazine/20141021/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2014wk43&utm_campaign=iw&e=1&m_i=iGRiP3nHsq2IWRKSPOiA9_NQxw0MrEh1ezGKOQUEwcQ_%2BV7yaWZ1osAPooW4CX_vj8j00Fobqfq77lJdYu3Kv9kr1Ze4y#14] People who are intrinsically motivated to interact with people earn more than the average, people who want to 'score' and to get bonuses earn less than the average. People with a company with a foreign headquarter, and working at big companies earn more.

Sales: [#NRC100512] You can't sell if you can't convince, or can make your message sticky enough to get known [Bernd Damme sent neatly-packaged old-ladies underwear to journalists, saying they could exchange it for a hand-made Italian tie] Also: start small, and talk about it with friends. [#SellHuman127] Services of salesperson may be to provide information, but nowadays people can find lots of information, value is when salespersons are confused, mistaken, or clueless about the true problem; problem finding is much more important then. [#227] Paying salespeople a fixed salary + 10% tied to company growth: total sales increased, same cost, less attrition {EW: better than 60% base salary + 40% commission}. Perhaps since it promotes collaboration between salespeople, and makes salespeople more eager to want to help customers.

Salience: [#SteelArt] Another word for discounting the future, or hyperbolic discounting, which basically means that now we value things that give immediate payoff over future benefits, while in the future, where the benefits would have been accrued, we regret not taking the future into account.

Salient points/salient features: [#Watt46/#EricB268] Instructions or lectures can be very helpful to be taught the most important point in a vast swab of literature or knowledge. [#EricB55] Due to limitations in working memory, experts cannot take all stimuli in at once, and focus on the salient features. Expertise learns people which features are important, and which are not (abstraction! Distinguishing signal from noise...)

Samuelson (Paul): [#Robi20] An economist, enchanted with mathematical economics during a kind of rebirth or enlightenment when he marveled at the simplicity of the Malthusian differential equations.

Sanctification: [#Lyobom245] Sanctify work? Love? Parenting?

Sanger, Fred: [#Hargit153] Had the principle that you have to break the limits of techological capabilities, to work out methods, to do new things.

SAR: [#EricB590] Short term apprehension and retrieval, also known as working memory.

Sassoon, Vidal: [#Robi164] Parents divorced, lived in orphanage for six years. Was sent by his mother to be a hairdresser, training with Adolph Cohen, who was an extremely disciplined man who taught Sassoon the needed structure and discipline. {EW: are scientists also disciplined?} Visited musea, got inspiration from art and architecture. “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.”

Satisfaction: [#DeMoor19] Labor satisfaction is helpful in reducing turnover and making it easier to recruit new employees. However, it's not enough for labor motivation, let alone performance. [#Flourish13] Reported satisfaction depends for 70% on the current mood and for 30% on true life satisfaction (performance etc.)

Satisficing: [#EricB406] Many experts (especially under time pressure) are satisficers, using the first solution that works well enough {EW: and of course leading to suboptimal decisions} [#NS121111] Satisficing heuristic: take first solution that is good enough

Savants: [#Nature_413_200901] Author (Snyder) argues that savant skills often emerge 'spontaneously' and do not improve qualitatively with time {even though pictures show a different story}. “Bright Splinters of the Mind” - Beate Hermelin. Though Snyder makes a point that people with brain damage can often draw better. Hermelin however calculates that savants use the same methods as normal people in arts or maths.

Saving message: [#Pino48] When using hypnosis on yourself, add a 'saving message' saying “this, or something better, I expect from my suggestion.'

Savoring: [#Lyubom199] Savoring helps against stress (especially past savoring). And mutual reminescing can also lead to positive feelings.

Savoring album: [#Lyubom206] May be good technique to try?

Scaling (psychology): [Maladaptively High and Low Openness: The Case for Experiential Permeability] Openness traditionally had a low relation to psychopathology, which changed when also maladaptive items were added to the 'upside', like 'I can fantastize exessively'

Scapegoating: [#Nass5] One trick that unpopular people use to make friends.

Scarcity: [#Denktank] Something that is hard to achieve is valued more – being a schoolteacher in Finland is harder to achieve than in the Netherlands, and perhaps because of that valued much more. [#Coyl118] Scarcity may also help as primal cue for music students who need to go in a lottery. {EW: but no school marks here? It may be that being scarce in the first place may be enough} [#Influence239] Sixth persuasion technique; partially works because framing something as potential loss is more powerful than framing it as potential gain. Exclusive information seems more valuable, you can construct 'double whammy' with 'inside information' that a product will soon be rare. Censoring information (like in law: disregard this information) makes people value it even more. Gets more powerful if scarcity increases (so first there were 10 cookies, now just two, instead of constantly 2 cookies), like revolutions trigger after progress is turned back. Parents who enforce discipline inconsistenly (so are reining in 'given' freedoms) tend to produce rebellious children. And scarcity due to social demand is the most effective scarcity of all. Fishers do this with “chum”, shops with “loss leaders”: some really good bargain that throw the public into a general buying frenzy. If losers come out smiling, it means that scarcity and competition brought something to an unhealthy frenzy. Logic goes out of the window with scarcity, so either be aware of arousal, or look at the experience: how much do you enjoy it? [#Bregma102] Scarcity helps people focus on and solve short-term problems, but makes them forget long-term problems, as the current challenges and crises take up too much attentional bandwidth. [#106] Scarcity is also relative: not only due to lack of X, but also because of expectations of X, which is mainly fueled with what people around you (appear to) have.

Schaufeli, Wlimar: [#C2W_carriere_2013] Labor psychologist; makes trainings to make people like their work (as engaged people have less health problems and more happiness; workaholics it's the other way around).

Schema: [#CIAch3] A schema is a sort of chunk of memory with all assorted information. People have a schema on for example, a restaurant, linking information on what to expect, how to behave, emotional responses, and experiences in restaurants. Information in SIS is usually accurate, however, if there is no appropriate schema, people have much more difficulty perceiving a stimulus correctly, instead of fitting it into the proper schema (quickly shown red spades) – the STM-contents are 'corrected'. {EW: perhaps LTWM is just the schema activation by the stimuli in SIS, leading to greater capacity of STM?} [#Zill193] Do strong positive emotions accompanying a music video enhance the learning of the presented schema? [#EricsD362] A schema generally has applicability conditions, slots, and draws conclusions which are the body of the schema.

Schema substitutes: [#Clar54] Illustrations and other learning tools often function as schema substitutes, they substitute for the information that a more experienced person would generate automatically from his or her schema.

Schiller, Friedrich: [#Greene198] Filled his desk drawer with rotten apples, as the smell delighted him and made him more creative. (Albert Einstein would periodically squeeze a rubber ball, Samuel Johnson required a cat on his desk, to make it purr, and a slice of orange)

Schizophrenia: [#NRC140411] Brain cells of schizophrenic persons have fewer dendrites/make fewer contacts than brain cells of healthy people. [#CiceroJan2012] Three-hit hypothesis: more dopamine in the brain, stress as baby (less maternal care->more cortisol), stress as adult (isolation). Less prepulse-inhibition (so second stimulus hits as hard as first, identical stimulus). But without extra dopamine sensitivity mismatch hypothesis is correct: if circumstances in life are not similar to those around birth, (so many contacts in contrast to few) schizophrenia results; but reversible then. Immigrants and citydwellers suffer more from schizophrenia.[#NS28012012] Could in some cases be caused indirectly by genes that deregulate the body clock. [#NS100710] Drugs that activate GABA-receptors increase attention span and ability to avoid automatic responses. [#NRC] (Lucia Talamini). Normal people use context to remember things (like words coupled with cityscape background); schizophrenics don't do better {EW: can be powerful way for new associations}. Have smaller hippocampus and less nerves from the hippocampus to surrounding area. [#NRC131110] Genes are only important in combination with abuse and trauma in youth, use of cannabis, social exclusion of minorities and living in a big city. Schizophrenics can also not judge the emotions and intentions of others well. [#NS150214] As many as 1 in 10 cases of schizophrenia may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction against brain cells. [#NS080613] Patients who hear voices can select an avatar that looks like the voice, the therapist goes to another room and uses both therapeutic talk and (as the avatar's voice) abusive talk, which becomes more supportive over time,[JulianLeff]. Most patients show improvement. [#http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleID=1906049 / http://psychcentral.com/news/2015/02/05/eight-different-types-of-schizophrenia/80805.html ] May be 8 diseases, each of which is caused by mutations in a specific gene cluster and associated symptoms (like word salad, or hearing voices) [#NS200416Shizophrenia'sFoundationsMayBeLaidDownInTheWomb] Neurons of schizophrenic people produce less miR-9, which causes the cells to migrate less far.

Schoenfeld: [#Clar328] Researcher who found that novice mathematicians latch upon the first seeming solution; expert mathematicians analyze more, and then quickly implement and verify if they're on the right track. {EW: quick-fail satisficing? Satisficing with better monitoring?}

School choice: [#OperationEducation180313] Many parents choose the school of their children because it is near, or because they were taught there themselves. CITO-scores may become more important. But are school cultures THAT different? 'competitive-cooperative / open (child-centered) – closed (teacher-centered). Part of culture in class will depend on what the teacher craves and what the teacher sees as his or her proper role. [EW: of course, science finds warmth and challenge, or clarity] Parents may want their child to be happy and successful. [#NRC101211] Leaving schools is often seen as a liberation by the lowly-educated.

School effects: [#Hatt33] Schools affect learning by classroom climate and peer influences. Errors must be welcomed, the environment must be safe and caring. In developed countries, school effects are often minimal (despite being the subject of most heated debate – though many bad schools simply are bad because they have a combination of bad teachers and underprivileged students, but that's not really a school effect)! Lack of disruptive students within classrooms is another factor that is important. Still, not really a 'school policy thing' like timetabling, class sizes, or school uniforms. [#Hatt72] Schools explain about 5-10% of differences in performance, the effect really minor compared to the effects of teachers and classes (42%). Exception is if there are very different school types (academic/vocational) and in poor countries like Africa. Charter(=private) schools seem to not be consistently better, religious schools somewhat outperform their atheist counterparts (d=0.25) Summer schools don't make too much of a difference, neither does desegregation. Residential halls also don't matter. Optimal high school size is about 800 students: is more when school is wealthy, less when there are more minority students; increased coordination costs with no extra benefits.

School improvement: [#NRC050913] Amsterdam was successful in reducing the number of weak schools: the city and school directions freed money, which was used for consultants and to train teachers.

School systems: [#McK] Good school systems select the right teachers, educate the teachers well, and have support systems to place each child under good instruction.

Schools: [#EW] As the original Latin proverb goes: “Non vitae, but scholae discimus”, we don't learn for life, we learn for school. Or more specific: for exams which will in the end allow us to enter a lucrative profession. The qualities required to do well in school are however not the same as the qualities required to do well in life: willingness to take risks, being able to thrive in an environment with contradictory information, not having all needed information available to solve problems. {EW: but is school suppressive because that is also what is expected of most people in society, to have well-regulated delta's and epsilon's doing the chores without giving their beta-supervisors headaches by thinking for themselves? Internal incompetence is as much if not more punished in society as it is in schools.} [#Ster439] It may have helped that Darwin's headmaster considered science a complete waste of time, guaranteeing that Darwin would not soil his interest in biology by unpleasant associations with school. [#http://dare.uva.nl/document/460158] Schools are supposed to have four central functions, allocation (of people over labor market), sorting, creating equal opportunity, and stimulating good citizenship. {EW: and education?}. Four dimensions are stratification (how many different trajectories for kids the same age), standardization (standardized tests/teachers), job-orientedness and freedom of choice/ease of change. [#Hargit124] Stuyvesant Highschool in New York focused on science and jumpstarted the career of several laureates. [#http://www.oratiereeks.nl/upload/pdf/PDF-4662weboratie_Oostdam_-_DEF.pdf] Schools/teachers explain about 20-25% of variance in student achievement. (or is that because schools are all so similar?) [#JohnChubb – Colander/Economics book] In the best schools, principals and teachers have autonomy, and accountability is to parents and students, not bureaucratic organisation (6000 people for NY public schools, 25 for NY private catholic schools). Also, having clear and relevant goals (academic excellence instead of 'the basics') and principals who want to lead (instead of disliking teaching).

Schröder, Marc: [#Busa22] Dutch entrepreneur. Has Stelios Haji-Ioannou and Richard Branson as role models. His father was a very successful businessman (but Marc did not like his business, or his father? Father as competitor, to be conquered, like “Karakter”? Is it possible to be inspired by someone whom you do not like? He respected his father, though, hands-on-management). Got the free hand of his first employers to create a new concept in fuel sales {autonomy}. Since he believed in his (own) concept, he worked very hard. Doesn't believe in being content, always is looking for things to improve, for opportunities. As an entrepreneur, you need to take risks! (though calculated risks). Doesn't feel good doing 'nothing'. Believes in very hard work. Likes being under pressure {?} Did do some research before tackling the ANWB. Doesn't like 'winning' as much as challenging the existing order {his father?}

Schrödinger, Erwin: [#Crop280] Father successful in linoleum business, but also near professional interest in botany, chemistry and Italian painting. Strong ties between father and son, dad shared his intellectual life with his son and only child {!} Inspired by the late Boltzmann's lectures, and found the lectures of his successor, Hasenörl, as a model. Was very intensely concerned with mathematical and philosophical problems of physics ('das ist der Schrödinger'). Was quite itinerant, self-exiled when Nazi's came to power, but settled in Ireland (was excellent lecturer, and people loved him also because of his mastery of the Gaelic language and knowledge of Irish music and Celtic design. Schrödinger also fell in love easily, and had many affairs and a forgiving wife. Strove for beauty in women and science; even beauty before science. Also very broad scientific work, from color vision to x-ray diffraction, general relativity and wave mechanics, also published the book 'What is life?', a foray into molecular biology that inspired Crick to switch from physics to biology. Schrödinger based his work on de Broglie, Einstein, and Hamilton, and optics. Saw science going back to the Greeks, and warned his colleagues that just talking amongst themselves and not making it part of general culture would atrophy and ossify their science. Believed that people should venture beyond their specialities.

Schutten, Jan-Paul: [#NRC090813] Writer, felt uncomfortable in crowd, analysed texts as a young man (literature, but also commercials, for example cadans between long and short sentences). Studied communication. Worked for commercial agency.

Schvaneveldt: [#EricB365] Used software to create concept maps, and find the voids and errors in the novice's knowledge {EW: useful for school?}

Schwinger, Julian: [#Crop387] Schwinger was Jewish, but very shy and introverted, preferred to stay out of school to read Dirac's work in the library. His academic career was faltering when his older brother introduced him to a graduate student, who brought him to the attention of the prominent physicist Isidor Rabi. Shed some of his shyness and became an accomplished lecturer.

Science club: [#KNCV] Check the Science Club of the KNCV.

Science programs: [#Hatt147] Laboratory experiences that aim to question, explain and encourage thinking at higher levels are much more effective than laboratory experiments to verify what has been previously presented. Relating content to previous knowledge and making it interested has the highest effect (d=1.48!) followed by collaborative learning strategies (d=0.67). Refutational texts can also help (cause cognitive dissonance in students).

Science students: [#Csik66] Science students seem to be more academically rounded than maths students – broader interest? Or memory is better while mathematicians may have superior intellect/processing speed? [#Csik114] Science seems less inherently enjoyable than arts or music {EW: well, the standard curriculum might...} [#Csik140] Science students seem more motivated by job perspectives and less by 'it impresses other people' or 'it is a way to get away from my problems'

Scientific interest: [#Feist72] Openness to experience, introversion and conscientousness (especially O and C) seem to correlate most to scientific interest. [#Feist75] Scientifically/mathematically precocious strudents are however only rarely retained in science/maths careers: 17% (male maths) 6% (female maths), 4%-3% male/female phys/natural scientists.

Scientific prominence: [#EW] <theory of> The prominence of a scientist is related to his or her total impact, meaning both the number of articles and the quality/innovativeness of those articles. Top scientists have several strategies to achieve this: first, they try avoid administration and non-research work, freeing up time. Second, they read widely and think deeply, so they can more easily identify high-impact areas and know if those problems would be relatively solveable. Third, they realize that sometimes no good answer can be found in reasonable time, so they abandon projects. Fourth, they like science, and think about it incessantly. Fifth, they try to encourage their own productivity and prevent neural habituation by having diverse interests and hobbies. [#Strien240] There really are differences in quality between scientists; the 'greats' have more discoveries, even if some of those discoveries are multiples.

Scientists: [#Ster280] Creative/eminent scientists distinguish themselves from their peers by more openness and more flexible thinking, more drive, ambition and achievement-oriented. Mastery and work-motivation (liking to work hard) were positively correlated to number of publications and citations, competitiveness positively related to number of publications, negatively to number of citations. Dominance, arrogance, hostility and self-confidence also seem useful. Finally autonomy, introversion and independence. (Independence seems to load on the research factor, extraversion on the teaching factor) [#Medaw3] There is no such thing as 'the scientist', there are artist-scientists, poet-scientists, philosopher-scientists, mystics, collectors, classifiers and compulsive tidiers-up, and even a few crooks. [#http://www.wisconsinacappella.com/what-can-make-a-genius-bbc-horizon/] Scientists have smaller/more tightly packed minicolumns {EW: like autistics?}+ excess of short connections compared to long connections. [#NS20112010] “This year we have had plenty [of physics graduates] come into the lab because the banks are not hiring.” [#NS210412] If you substitute one L-shaped block that will stand up straight with one that doesn't, chimps will just keep trying to do it again, while children will try to shake and 'diagnose' the block to find out why it doesn't work anymore. [#C2W-carriere_2013] Cees Dekker and Herman de Boer call 'verwondering', leergierigheid, het hebben van veel energie (en bij vlagen ontzettend hard kunnen werken) en een goed oog voor hoofd- en bijzaken belangrijke eigenschappen om in de wetenschap en bij het starten van ondernemingen succesvol te zijn.Cees Dekker asks not what is happening in his area now, but what he expects to happen in 5 to 10 years. [#C2WMedicinesOkt12] Every year, 3700 people in the Netherlands get their PhD, and there's only place for 250 new professors. Only 2 to 3 sits at home involuntarily, but most companies are not overly eager to hire PhDs (too specialized, not very much experience) [#HankeKorpershoek] Students who choose scientific subjects at school are more introverted, conscientious, and more emotionally stable than their peers. [#Thagard14] Scientists are more conscientious, dominant, achievement oriented, and driven. They are independent, introverted, and less sociable, emotionally stable and impulse controlled.

Scientmanship: [#Meda44] Taking credit to oneself or discrediting the originality or work of colleagues in a non-scientific way, for example “That's exactly what I thought after conducting the experiments in Pasadena”, or saying that both your ideas harken to an older source, or that you are so critical that you are never convinced of the other's idea.

Scott: [#NS01102011] Scott once said that 'gentlemen don't practice', and seemed to prefer heroism instead of careful planning and organisation.

Scrappiness: [#Weiner156] May be a characteristic of locations of genius.

Scripting critical moves: [#Switch183] If you're hungry and need a can of food, you're three times better off relying on a jerk with a map than a budding young saint without one!

Scrum: can also be used in improve education (eduScrum). Why does SCRUM work? Theory…1) Less time spent on waiting/being idle/doing things of minor benefit/cost ratio by better coordination. 2) Better access to resources (knowledge, social network, skills, machinery) than an individual would have: more value for greater time. 3) Due to diversity in knowledge, being able to foresee and prevent problems, instead of having to (try to) solve them when it is nearly too late or too late. So earlier feedback. 4) forced reflection, so waterfall-caused problems are percevied and solved earlier. 5) forced earlier feedback? 6) less time wasted on planning? 7) Inspect and adapt cycle: every once in a while, stop what you are doing, review what you have done, decide whether it is what you should have been doing, and see if you can improve it. 8) focus on what brings most value (so not on 'all things that must/could be done) [#Suther19] Perhaps it also helps that in scrum certain people are responsible (the pigs), while others only need to be informed (the chickens, like in the ham and eggs-restaurant). Avert “Not my job” - there needs to be a total product

Sculptors: [#Bloo90] Parents often emphasized not doing something in particular, but doing what one did very well, to be 'good people' (hard-working, disciplined). Parents for some reason never emphasized the importance of money. Most parents appreciated arts (some even had arts as a hobby), but some really didn't show appreciation for it. Most sculptors as children loved to draw, and got very positive responses from their family members (loved the appreciation?) Often they saw art as a way to make something real, not as a way of droodling without purpose. Also built a lot of things, sometimes from wood, most often from paper and cardboard. Quite a lot had music instruction, only a few had art instruction, but that was rather free-form and irregular. Some art at elementary school, but none saw that as serious instruction. Parents often displayed what their children made in the house (interestingly, the parents didn't save many of the stories the children made, so there may have been a sort of subconscious bias). Encouragement of friends, getting an identity as an artist. High school classes were bad, more art as a craft, for children who would not go to college anyway, {low standards?} not given by professional artists. Some children did get art instruction by professionals, found by their parents. People who were artists first, teachers second, made all the difference in college. The young sculptors SAW art being made, and the pros set very high standards. The students also learned a lot from their fellow-students. Found out that they may have not have had as much “talent” as some others seemed to have, but that it was the drive that counted much more. Read all art books they could find. Many grew through a copying stage. Parents not overly happy with financial aspects of life as an artist, and had 'good advice' but continued moral support. Ambitious to be a great artist, not to make a great reputation. Self-discipline was incredibly important, as was a community.Tend to be a bit obsessive about art, think about it all the time.

Second opinion: [#CIAch6] Getting a second opinion can be useful

Secondary emotions: [#Nelissen127] Often involve others and social rules. Usually necessitate activation of the prefrontal cortex; take longer to come into being, but also last longer. 'Self-conscious' emotions since they require sense of self.

Secrecy: [Meda42] Secrecy is a disfigurement in a scientist; one's colleagues are seldom in a hurry to do one's own research, and when silent you learn nothing in return. Tell your colleagues everything, but be prepared to listen attentively to their stories as well.

Secret: [#vdVorst28] You can arouse curiosity by labeling something as a secret (the secrets of glass-blowing or whatever).

Security: [#Ster376] The 'bureaucratic personality' craves security (as well as status), and rules are easily transformed into idols, rule-breaking as well as loss of control is considered a threat to safety.

Seductive details: [#Clar155] Opening a lesson with something that is not directly content-related (such as the consequences of product failure in a course on quality control). Interferes with learning by activating inappropriate prior knowledge {EW: but may increase motivation/interest? learners apparently do enjoy such things} Also called the coherence effect (negative effect from emotionally arousing material) Mechanism of work is probably the activation of inappropriate prior knowledge, seductive details are less harmful (yet still harmful) after the lesson! Note that stories can still be very useful for training (motivation, memorable), but need to be selected with extreme care!

See-feel-change: [#HeaB106] Works better than analyze-think-change.

Seeding: [#EW/#Ster197] Giving some data on aliens (for example, having feathers) will usually prompt people to add beaks too... apparently, the associative networks activated greatly influence the final product.

Seeman, Jeff: [#C2WCarriereEnOpleiding2014] A brilliant mind, being impatient, a focus bordering on the inflexible, hating compromises, some narcissism and an elephant skin that does not show any internal doubts. Seeman thinks you need to pick the right subjects.

Selection: [#Coyl130] Selecting people out of a class may help the others work hard, because they don't feel very safe (primal cues) {EW. I'm unsure how good that 'rule by fear' would work in the long run, though} [#http://onderwijs.vkbanen.nl/banen/artikel/Selecteren-is-beter-dan-loten/94428.html] Selecting students works better than a lottery; students with 8+ grades do best of all, but below 7 the grades have little predictive value, and testing for motivation ('buitenschoolse activiteiten', knowledge (on a medical subject like diabetes or high blood pressure). and study skills is a better predictor of success; 2.5 times as little dropout. [#EricC4] Old selection tests used criteria that predicted success during job training, not actual success on the job. Supervisor ratings or knowledge tests were not very reliable. [#Intermediair140313] Only reliable predictors of job performance are internships, test opdrachten, IQ tests, and structured interviews that are the same for each candidate [Paul Boselie http://www.uu.nl/rebo/medewerkers/JPPEFBoselie ]

Selectivity: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140407153251-8353952-the-difference-between-successful-and-very-successful-people?trk=eml-mktg-inf-m-top14-1210-p11] Very successful people are absurdly selective – they also say no to some great opportunities (Warren Buffet [rumored] “The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.” )

Self: [#NS230213] The primary function of self-identity may be to help us build relationships to others, so the nature of the self may depend on the social environment in which it develops. [#NS220417TheGoodDelusion] We see the moral part of people as their true self, and tend to believe the true self of other people is good (at least according to our own values) -liberals saw Pierpont’s true self as gay, conservatives saw his true self as gayness-abnegation.

Self-acceptance: [#EW/Franzen101] Is self-acceptance necessary to focus one's energies on the problems to be solved in life, instead of wallowing in one's own misery?

Self-affirmation theory: [#Redirect229] By focusing on the things you do well and that are important to you, you take the sting out of things that do not go so well. Self-affirmation can break or prevent the vicious cycle of discouragement in students.

Self-analysis: [#Carnxxiv] Every week freeing time to analyze yourself (which mistakes you made, what you did right, how you could improve performance, and what lessons you can learn from your experience) may be very useful.

Self-care: [#Csik93] Interestingly, talented teens spend twice as much time at self-care than other adolescents. {EW: higher SES? Higher need for approval?}

Self-competition: [#Ster415] Self-competition =mastery orientation, striving to improve your own record. Outperforming yourself can be more motivating and more reliable than striving to outperform others.

Self-confidence: [#EW] Self-confidence may be needed for people and children to try unravel mysteries or try prove theorems. Lack of self-confidence will stop such exercises in their tracks. [#Watt253] Let the unconfident answer easy questions, and praise them. The overconfident should be shown the error of their ways. [#Robi180] The second function of mentors is to boost self-confidence, to give people the feeling that they can achieve their goals - or even more. [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126746-5,00.html] Parents who set tough but realistic goals, applaud successes but go easy on failures are most likely to get children with high self-confidence. [#Busa160] Self-confidence is important for all who want to excel {since they must have confidence that their efforts will pay off?} [#Clar359] The best way to get self-confidence is to experience success, or to see others like you be successful. [#NRC]020906] Writing down what things you're good in and why they are important helps self-confidence and hence grade of black children; no effect is seen in white children, who may have a positive self-image already. {apparently it's not 'one size fits all'- different people may have different factors hampering their learning} [#Franzen249] Often, self-confidence is based on the appreciation we receive from others. [#Franzen261] People with low self-confidence tend to strengthen it by more easily accepting negative feedback than positive feedback, have lower expectancy, and are more likely to quit when troubles arise. [#Strien32] Jusus Mayer had thought of a periodic table almost simulaneous to Mendeleev, but was not yet confident enough to publish. [#274] May be important for geniuses. [#McGraw2] Self-confidence may be situational, like Oprah on screen. Possibly eroded by negative emotions caused by violent verbal attacks in her case?

Self-control: [#Marshmallow] Secret to self-control is strategic allocation of attention – in other words, distract yourself with something else! Anything but the 'hot' stimulus! [#HeaB11] Self-control is exhaustible resource, burned up by managing the impression we're making on others, coping with fears, controlling our spending (or other impulses such as cookie-eating), focusing on simple instructions such as 'don't think of a white bear', and many, many other situations. [#http://thyroid.about.com/b/2004/01/07/the-good-news-and-bad-news-about-self-control.htm] Due to self-control exhaustion, people who are changing a habit can become crabby. [#Vonk] You can train self-control by using your other hand for the computer mouse, improve your posture, stop halfway peeing, or exercise [http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Oaten-Longitudinal-gains-in-self-regulation-from-regular-physical-exercise.pdf] You can have a plan on how to respond correctly to a tempting situation, or invoke your identity. [#Benjamin de Boer] There is start conntrol and stop-control, which are more or less independent. [#http://daily-social-worker.blogspot.com/2011/07/armoede-is-een-kwestie-van-wilskracht.html] Self-control is also depleted by 'trade-off-thinking', having to decide whether to spend money if you have little of it; poor people therefore deplete self-control more quickly than rich people. [#McGon105] For better self-control, forget virtue, and focus on goals and values. [#Flourish210] Higher self control: 56% less chance on cardiovascular disease. [#NS080314] People who exhibit greater self-control in childhood grew into healthier, more emotionally stable adults. PNAS, vol 108, p2693.

Self-correction: [#Dwec109] A company {EW: or individual} who cannot correct itself cannot thrive, as people with fixed mindsets tend to hide mistakes instead of addressing them.

Self-criticism: [#McGoni148] Self-criticism associates with less motivation and worse self-control, self-forgiveness is much better! Try on the role of a good friend or mentor who believes in you.

Self-deception: [#NS081011, Robert Trivers] Con-artists use your self-deception to control you. It's mainly useful for deceiving others, by diminishing your cognitive load when lying, and by boosting your ego. [#Sommers142] Self-deception helps us bounce back from setback and trudge on through failure.

Self-determination theory: [#NS] For happiness, people need autonomy, a sense of competence (belief in the effectiveness of our actions {EW: pride, feeling valuable}), and relating to other human beings.

Self-direction: [#Parr33] The ability to take some achting te stjdistance sometimes from ones goals and reflect on whether the course needs to be adapted; also called 'self-regulation'.

Self-discipline: [#Coyl150] Self-discipline is twice as important as IQ for predicting a student's grade point average. [#Csik68] Gifted teens usually have high academic performance (though less so in arts and athletics) – but is it the intellect who gives them giftedness, or self-discipline, or a combination of both?

Self-doubt: [#DeMoor39] Self-doubt leads to stress, and diminishes performance by shifting the focus from how to best do the task to the consequences of failure.

Self-education: [#Colv121] Since success in any business depends on deep knowledge of it, educating yourself via books, courses, interviews with experts etc. is vital, even though so very few people do it and so few companies encourage it.

Self-efficacy: [#EricB158] How confident someone is that he or she can do a particular task. Correlates quite well with expertise when the task is well defined and individuals have some experience with it. {EW probably not with real beginners?} [#Hatt47] Self-efficacy correlates well to achievement. [#GiftednessMusicPres] Influences choices we make, the effort we put forth, how long we persist when encountering obstacles, and how we feel. [#DeMoor38] Self-efficacy has both a general component, as a situation-specific component (someone feeling comfortable talking to a 8, but not to a 9.5). But enhanced self-efficacy tends to generalize to other situations(!). [#Franzen186] Self-efficacy seems to influence choices more strongly than expectancy (of the value of the result). [#Redirect146] Helping mothers develop their self-efficacy makes it less likely that their children become criminals or run away. Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) helps young children gain self-control, tolerate frustration better, and better recognize other's emotions {EW: simply due to less stress?}

Self-esteem: [#Mehr148] Self-esteem correlates positively with social success. [#Boll38] Self-esteem drops when you think that everyone else is winning, except for you. [#Wallin39] We get defensive whenever our self-esteem is threatened {EW: that's probably why raising someone's self-esteem makes them more receptive to criticism} [#Franzen160] Self-efficacy and self-esteem are different constructs, but they are correlated. [#NS280412] Your self-esteem (and the esteem of others for you) drops if you try to get people to acknowledge you; the thing that does work is caring about the well-being of the other person. [#Burkeman117] Rate your individual acts as good or bad, if you like. But leave your self out of it.

Self-evaluation: [#Colv119] Great performers self-evaluate after the work, and (due to set goals) are more specific than poor performers. Set the standards beyond your current limits, and neither too low (not challenging) nor too high (demotivating). {read Zimmerman?} [#Tonn47] It is good to evaluate yourself. Your looks, your voice, your clothes, make-up, hairstyle, how you move, what others say about you, compliments as well as criticisms, any special skills you have, skills you've learned, your character, what you have learned to believe or disbelieve (what hurt your soul?). Both praises and criticisms can be helpful – either eliminate your weak spots, or trademark them. And you can always take lessons to gain skills or get rid of handicaps, or ask visagists and clothes experts for advice. [#Franzen260] Most people evaluate themselves on four main points: their looks, their social skills, their achievement, and their 'material outcomes' (wealth?)

Self-explanations: [#Clar220] Learners who construct self-explanations learn better than learners who do not. A good self-explanation goes beyond paraphrasing the material -it links concepts in the lesson together with each other or with existing knowledge. Predicting AND explaining the prediction works much better than predicting alone. However, explaining incorrect information does not help; it's better if people explain correct answers (as for example given by the teacher). Is important in demonstrations – explaining the steps prevents shallow processing of the examples.

Self-fulfilling prophecy: [#Bloo491] related to the Matthew effect, a small difference may lead to much greater opportunities and increased self-confidence. [#Jussim] Self-fulfilling prophecies are stronger if children enter new/unfamiliar situations (such as high school, or first grade), and teachers are higher in dogmatism or cognitive rigidity, and in groups which have some social stigma (such as African-American students). Note that part of the expectancy effect is often because 1) teachers' judgment is often rather accurate, and 2) teacher's expectancies influences grades much more than objectively administered tests. [#Redirect208] Even in random experiments 'bloomers' do better because teachers act more warmly towards the bloomers, challenge them with more difficult material, and helped them with their answers when they were wrong.

Self-help books: [#Greene115] People are reluctant to tell others the truth about themselves – their weaknesses, their inadequacies, flaws in their work. Even the self-help books tend to be soft and flattering, telling us what we want to hear – that we are basically good and can get what we want by following a few simple steps. [#EW] But as Burns indicates: self-help books like 'Feeling Good' can really help people.

Self-image: [#KettingvraagGuidoTerra->] In the Netherlands, fewer girls choose exact studies because their self-imagine with respect to science is worse. {EW: that's probably true. But why? And isn't desirability also a problem?} [#Csik75] Self-image seems a bit lowish for the talented teens compared to their peers. [#Bran] One's self-image can be turned more positive if one uses multiple smaller, believable steps. [#DeMoor43] The most important component shaping self-image is social comparison, and looking at what characteristics are appreciated in the society.

Self-interest: [#Sidis] Children don't have as much self-interest yet as adults, and are therefore open to learning everything, whether or not it advances their interests {EW: that may be logical, since a child cannot know well yet what is useful and what is useless due to their own lack of knowledge. It may also be though that adults evolutionary grow stronger egos and get more narrow-minded} [#EW<-DeGroot] Are many of our choices not as much pure self-interest as they are 'social interest' or 'clever self-interest?'

Self-knowledge: [#Watt347] Know your own strengths and weaknesses, talents and preferences and vulnerable points.

Self-licensing: [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClFA3cHHB5s&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=2] People indulging after reminding how much progress they have made towards their goal. Much better is to remind yourself why the goal is important to you [the Big (true?) Real Goal, that hits you in the gut], and stressing not the progress, but your commitment to the goal. + 'the kind of person who...'

Self-maintaining: [#Flourish50] A therapy is only self-maintaining if practicing it gives large and clear and immediate benefits (so not cognitive-behavioural therapy, but active constructive reacting can work!). Otherwise a habit may become extinct… [#EW] Make it a habit? Add rewards yourself? Or internalizing/pride?

Self-observation: [#Colv118] Observing oneself during ones actions is useful.

Self-perception: [#Sommers137] Our self-perception is less focused on accuracy than on self-enhancement and ego-stroking.

Self-questioning: [#Hatt193] Self-questioning can be quite effective for learning (d=0.64), especially for low-ability students (high ability students may already do it), best for pre- and post-lesson questioning, delayed questions better than immediate questioning, and having a teacher modeling works better than no modeling.

Self-recording: [#EricB712] Self-recording is most effective when it does not only track one's performance, but also the conditions that surround it. May be stopped once a person has reached acceptable levels. Seems very useful for increasing sports or writing skill.

Self-reflection: [#Watt53] Self-reflection may be important too.

Self-regulation: [#EricB705] self-generated thoughts, feelings and actions that are strategically planned and adapted to the attainment of personal goals. Involves regulating cognitive and affective processes, behaviour, and environment in a cyclus of forethought, performance and self-reflection. Four key ingredients are self-efficacy, outcome expectations (ultimate end of learning), task interest/valuing and goal orientation (value learning more than achievement). [#EricB715] 90% of serve quality seems to be determined by self-regulation (better goals, planning, strategy use, etc.) Self-regulation also seems to increase motivation {because people feel more in control?} [#GiftednessMusicPres] Self-regulation is what happens if external regulation is internalized: first Why:Vicarious or direct reinforcement by others ? Self-set goals, selfreinforcement and self-efficacy. How? Method Task strategies are modeled or guided socially Self-initiated covert images and verbal strategies When? Time Time use is socially planned and managed ? Time use is selfplanned and managed. What? Behaviour Performance is socially monitored and evaluated ? Performance is selfmonitored and evaluated Where? Physical Environment ? Environments are structured by others Environments are structured by self With whom? Social Help is provided by others Help is sought personally. EW: seems like scaffolding (not only for practice time): first little freedom, then freedom increases as the competence of the student grows and he or she can make more sensible adaptations.

Self-relevance effect: [#Wiki] Events in one's own life are better remembered than things happening to someone else.

Self-selected repertoire: [#Renwick2002] Clarissa used much more silent fingering, silent thinking and singing when she liked the piece [EW: so reducing working memory load to be able to pay more attention?]. Also spent more time practicing, and persevered despite difficulties.

Self-steering: [#EW] Would I have enjoyed drawing more if I had been allowed to pick my own subjects?

Self-study: Newton/Einstein/Feynman, [#Hargit118] Lipscomb studied quantum mechanics on his own since nobody in chemistry knew anything about it.

Self-talk: [#Hatt199] Positive self-talk regarding an error ('I have made an error. Great! I learned something.”) is helpful when learning, especially as it helps keep our attention on our task rather than ourselves. [#NRC040811] Is also useful for sports – if precision is required, self talk on posture ('elbow up') is most effective; for things requiring 'uithoudingsvermogen', the 'come on'/'I feel good'-motivational talk. Also, self-talk improves with training. [#http://thetalentcode.com/2014/08/27/24-rules-for-becoming-an-adult-prodigy/] Use “you”, not “I”

Self-worth: [#Gall108] In our society, most people are imbued with an equation between self-worth and performance. (Can lead to games of Good-O) [#http://www.intermediair.nl/weekblad/20140619/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2014wk25&utm_campaign=iw&e=1#5] People who don't equate self-worth and performance are better able to handle criticism and learn more of their mistakes.

Selling: [#EW] Most customers/clients are not expert enough to distinguish good from bad solutions, what product or solution they choose is therefore not determined by the objective quality of the solution, but by the quality of the presentation/salestalk. [#SellHuman1] Many of us spend large part of day trying to convince others to part with resources, though often resources other than money. [#34] Even engineers sell by building something so unique and exciting that someone will be moved to buy {EW: make exciting software?} Or forward-deployed engineers looking what customer needs (account executives or people from the sales division fail in such tasks). Also may identify problems the customer doesn't know he has. Selling is also for people to get their way if they don't have the power or authority from their job title. [#56] Now has to do more with persistence and empathy: would I sell this to my grandmother? Nowadays some people (middle class) suffer due to internet less from information asymmetry, lower class may not do homework/research in advance, though. CarMax has set price: no haggling anymore {EW: like supermarket?} and commission is based on number of sales, not size of sale. [#75] Imagining what other person is thinking is more useful in negotiations than imagining what the other person is feeling. Subtly mimicking the other's mannerisms also helps – but also gives better deals for _both_ parties! Touching people once on the upper arm helps too. Best salespeople are not extraverts but ambiverts: extraverts suffer from excess of assertiveness and zeal: contacting customers too often and talking too much and listening too little. [#SellHuman131] Best salespeople do not sell candy (to stores); they sell insights about the confectionery business.

Semantic memory: [#Wolt31] The memory storing facts like the meaning of words. Is actually the residue of thousands of overlapping episodic memories, like a Kohonen network after numerous training cycles. [#EricB539] Contrast to episodic memory. Is (automatically?) organized as people gain more experience. [#NS281115] May result from repeating an autobiographical memory lots of times, so it loses the personal context [so memory just has two categories: implicit and explicit].

Semantic orientation: [#EricB549] Judging the pleasantness of the image association formed in memory methods.

Semmelweis: [#Greene148] Was not able to turn his attention away from his 'battle' with Klein. Did not continue his experiments, and withdrew to the medical backwater town of Budapest, cutting himself off from the rest of the medical community.

Sensation seeking: [#Zill78] High sensation-seekers prefer more arousing experiences, whether they are positive or negative. Low sensation-seekers prefer arousing positive more than neutral more than arousing negative. Difference may reside in the subcortical limbic systems.

Sense: [#http://www.wisconsinacappella.com/what-can-make-a-genius-bbc-horizon] Are our brains hardwired to try make sense of the world, get cause-effect relationships, even if we're blind? Control the world? Latch on to anything promising?

Senses: [#Medi207] The senses lower each other's tresholds, 'multimodal reinforcement'. Something perceived with more senses is detected more easily and also remembered better. It even increases problem-solving! [#Gall52] Looking at and feeling your actions is much better than verbally describing them. [#Kluw190] Hypotheses generated by higher levels of neurons in the absence of sufficient information can be 'fed back' to the perceptual neurons to try whether the hypothesis is correct {expectancy thinking?}. [#NS020213] Most dreams seem to be 'silent movies', taste smell and touch are even rarer than sound – does this reflect the amount of brain real estate of the different senses? [#NRC201110] Seeing a picture of a damping bowl of soup makes people feel warm (and buy?) [#NS241015-”See more smartphone”] Smartphone can be tuned to see infrared light – will smartphones (and other apparatus) enhance our senses and thereby change what we can perceive (and learn?) [#NS241015-”Tickled babies are difficult to trick”] Our senses are all mixed up – tickling feet if legs are crossed results in most adults not knowing which feet is ticked, even while blind invididuals are not fooled. 4-month old babies also are not tricked (6 months-olds are) – as if their senses are not integrated yet. [#NS180316MakingSenses] The brain can adjust to having added an extra sense (like seeing infrared light), though some areas (like the visual cortex) are better at learning such patterns than other parts.

Sensitivity: [#Ster144] Creative people may actually be more sensitive to light and sound and electric shocks (or oversensitive) than uncreative people. [#https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/nieuws/2017/05/proefschrift-roxanna-camfferman-pedagogische-wetenschappen?utm_source=170523&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=proefschrift-roxanna-camfferman-pedagogische-wetenschappen] Fewer children overweight if parents are more sensitive during meals – not pressuring when child indicates it had enough, and also reacting adequately when a child makes miscellaneous remarks, like that it saw a cat. Hypothesis: sensitive raising of a child decreases child’s stress, and/or teaches child to handle emotions better, so not handle problems by overeating.

Sensitivity analysis: [#CIAch6] Ask oneself on which facts/factors/assumptions the ultimate judgement critically hinges, and question those: what could make those assumptions wrong or obsolete?

Sensory information storage: [#CIAch3] The SIS is a memory system that stores the impressions of the senses for a couple of tenths of a second, to allow the brain to continue processing a stimulus for the few moments after the stimulus has faded. [#Draaisma8] For sound, the box is 2 to 4 seconds.

Serendipity: [#Strien138] It may be wise to be able, when making a serendipitous discovery, to put all other things aside. Also, luck plays a role because which factors are paid attention to are also influenced by recently consulted papers, personal experiences, perhaps even the time of day.

Serial founder effect: [#QuentinAtkinsonScience] African languages are tone-rich, because they were surrounded by other populations who also invented tones, and tones were exported/imported (bit like island models). But when a group split off, they were not surrounded by others anymore, so some tones were lost.

Serial jack-of-all-trades: [#EW/Ster375] Constantly having to master new task may take up mental energy that is required for creativity.

Serial position effect: [#Wiki] The first and last items of a list are most likely to be remembered ('recency effect' and 'primacy effect'). The primacy effect seems to have to do with more repetitions/more elaborate attention/encoding into long-term memory; the recency effect with the freshest traces in working memory. [#Higbee53] If recall is asked fast, the last items are remembered better; if recall is delayed, the first few items. Use it to put the less meaningful/more complex items to learn at the start and end of the list, or spend more time learning the middle of the list.

Serotonin: [#Eyse229] Lower serotonin levels may correlate to psychoticism (and lesser inhibition of agression), similar as higher dopamine levels do {and high dop/high sero? ? Eyse: no, they counteract each other}[#Grin94] Low serotonin levels correlate to depression, the lower the serotonin level, also the more violent the method of suicide. Low serotonin levels can make kids hyperactive and aggressive; adults impulsive, risk-taking and aggressive {self-medication?} Serotonin-receptors are involved in satiation. XTC stimulates serotonin-release. Serotonin regulates the treshold of the fight/flight system. Serotonin is also released by sports. Monkeys with low serotonin occupied the lowest ranks, with higher serotonin levels (drugs) they became friendlier and more relaxed (and hence seemed more dominant).Yet their low serotonin-levels are not 'wrong', they just behave differently but can still be very useful to monkey society. [#NS240710] Actually, in people with panic disorder, the level of serotonin is two times higher; in people with untreated depression, two times higher. It seems as if depression is a lack of serotonin in the right places and an excess of serotonin on the wrong places (like on the 5-HT2C-receptors that promote anxiety instead of on the 5-HT2A receptors that inhibit it.) [#Nelissen208] Low serotonin – low mood. Higher serotonin [like testosterone!] higher social status and higher social skills, which increases serotonin.

Servant-leadership: [#SellHuman219] A desire to serve first, then conscious choice makes one lead. Do those served grow as persons? Do they become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants? [Servant selling? 'Upserve']

SES: [#Some611] Socioeconomic status. Lower socioeconomic status (at least in academia) gives higher tacit knowledge {even though this is hard to combine with the Oppenheimer – Langlan difference; Gladwell would also suggest socioeconomic status backwards – though perhaps one should see middle class – upper class; for girls there was not much of a difference, so motivation may be most important. But would motivation correlate with tacit knowledge (people KNOWING they should take notes after class, but not doing it?) {EW: would SES-IQ-link be lower for women?} [#Csik70] Talented teens have significantly more often richer and better-educated parents, with father having a high-status occupation and mother incredibly often being a college graduate. [#Csik206] Socio-economic status helps students perform well at the start of high school, but does not seem to make long-term commitment more likely. [#Redirect76] higher-SES partents talk to their kids in a way that encourages them to question, analyze and to think about the social and physical world, which sharpens their thinking and prepares them for school. Talk 2000 words per hour versus 1300 words per hour; when 3 years old, high-SES children know 50% more words than low-SES children. [#Redirect210] Children born in poverty also move more often, which is an extra disruption of their schooling.[#215] Carolina Abecadarian Project: intensive preschool at 4 months to starting school, attending college is 35% compared to control group of 13%. KIPP may work, but 'Promise Academies' (Harlem Children's Zone) definitely work as they're randomly controlled. [#NRC101211/MarkElchardus] The life expectancy of highly educated people is 5 to 7 year higher in NL/belgium than that of lowly-educated people; highly-educated people are also happier with their life. Note that booming education makes the number of highly-educated people explode: from 2% to 29%, while lowly educated went from 91% to 37%. But there are two 'scheidslijnen': a cultural one and a socio-economic one. The socio-economic one is weakening in de 'verzorgingsstaat', but the cultural one remains prominent. However, cultural gap widens (in non-verzorgingsstaten, highly educated people distrust the government, in verzorgingsstaten, highly-educated people trust the government much more)

Sesame street: [#NRC120213] Over 1000 scientific studies, toddlers watching Sesame street were better prepared for primary school, learned better there and were more socially skilled. Even in puberty children who had watched Sesame street received higher grades.

Session: [#Ster233] Sessions 2-4 hours in length seem optimal for deliberate practice, though musicians recommend shorter sessions, with breaks in between.

Set: [#http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm] Learning sets of items (like countries) is much harder than learning enumerations, since in the second case your brain works exactly the same time at every repetition.

Setback: [#Robi13] Even the most successful have had to endure many setbacks as well, the road to success is never smooth and easy. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201008/how-pessimism-can-make-you-rich] It's best to try imagine the setbacks you (or another person) would encounter, in advance, and think of ways of dealing with that. Intentions don't matter much for recuperating from setbacks or resisting temptations, action plans do.

Sex: [#Zill180] Sex increases liking of music videos, but the combination of sex and violence decreases it (violence itself has equivocal effects). [#Bregman17] Sexual intercourse may help raise grades, while self-pleasuring does not {EW: oxytocin?} [#NS160416IsThereAGeneForLosingYourVirginity]People lose their virginity earlier of they come from poorer families, are not religious, or if their parents have little involvement in their lives.

Sexual attitudes: [#Csik74] The only difference in attitude between talented and untalented students is that the talented ones are more conservative in sexual attitudes and less certain of their attractiveness.

Shadow side: [#Int17022012] Each 'talent' has its shadowside: enthusiasm (energetic, 'bevlogen') – shadow=moody, intense, can get upset. Careful: makes few mistakes – avoids risks. Observant: good knowledge of office politics – cynical, distrustful, aggressive. Reserved: does not sway easily, still performs under stress – distant, doesn't take feelings of others into account, poor communicator. Jovial: charmant, good social skills – too cooperative, postpones work, can't handle requests for higher productivity. Brave: self-confident, charismatic – megalomania, feels entitled to rewards. Result-oriented: willing to take risks, charming – seeks borders, manipulative, deceptive. Colourful: amusing, interesting – expressive, dramatical, wants to be center of attention. Visionair: out of the box thinker – strange, eccentric. Hard-working: hard-working, high standards – too perfectionistic. Team player: observant, good source of information for managers – conforming, wants to be liked by manager. [#Loehrs161/EW] We all have a shadow side of things we repress (strong longings we have which we do not allow due to our own identity/what our parents and such deemed proper) – people we dislike often display this side. Or perhaps because we are normal humans with emotions ranging towards both extremes, but our identity/who we want to be a bit (too) far from normal or from our natural setpoint.

Shakespeare: [#Imagine221] Shakespeare lived in an age obsessed with the theatre, and he plagiarized a lot / any source informed his art. Besides, he could get away with it. Also, theatre companies toured everywhere, from the court to the streets {so more ties/acquaintances}

Shallow knowledge: [#Will104] Shallow knowledge is much better than no knowledge at all, and it is a natural step on the way to deep knowledge {just don't give your students the impression that shallow knowledge is all there is, also in the questions you ask}

Shame: [#Nelissen132] One of three secondary emotions, with guilt and pride. Whereas pride is a reward for 'fitting in' socially, shame and guilt are reactions on doing something that is socially disapprovable. Both guilt and shame motivate self-improvement, but shame tends to paralyze “I am bad” [EW: would shame be the depression-version of guilt 'this action is bad'?]. Guilt and shame both increase empathy.

Shannon: Worked at MIT, near/with? Vannevar Bush, later went to Bell Labs

Shaping: [#Grin111] If you want an animal to learn complex behaviour, reward (accidental?) behaviour that goes in the right direction, for example rewarding a pig to go to the piano, then to stand straight against it, then put his paws on the keyboard {EW: endless possibilities- also with people? Teaching me to get up early?} [#https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13491-0 / Sharing of science is most likely among male scientists] Male scientists are more willing to share low-cost (reprints) or high-cost (data) than females are, at least when requested by another male. The other combinations seem about equally generous. H-index correlates slightly more negatively, though.

Sharing: [#DeMoor60] People who share more of their values and goals between themselves and the organisation have less stress and feel much more loyal and connected to the organisation.

Sharpness: [#Paul186] what the Avatip describe as self-realization. Having more autonomy, being able to endure pain and hardship better, and to require less to satify physical needs.  Also partly caused by becoming more accomplished and therefore being able/allowed to not follow rules that strictly anymore.

Shell: [#Howe55] Most successful creatives, such as Darwin, form a sort of “shell” to protect them from unwanted and distracting intrusions from outside life, such as social contacts and politics, though everyone does this his or her own way.

Shen Kuo: [#Weiner80] Was probably neurotic, and did not have great social or political skills.

Sherlock: [#Clar10] A computer training simulator, teaching 8 years of experience within 25 hours!

Shifting goals: [#EricB717] Shifting goals from process to outcome is more useful than either focusing on process goals or outcome goals exclusively.

Shifting standards: [#Syed14] Standards in most fields of endeavour have been improving; the fastest time of the 1896 Olympic marathon was just a few minutes faster than the current entry time for Boston's marathon.

Shigihara, Laura: [#wow.com] Seems to have been very sensitive to sounds from a young age, as she had favourite voice actors. 11 years of piano lessons, experimented with drums and guitar. Fell in love with mixing software in college, spent many hours remixing and making her own songs. Got started in video games by working on her first game for free, building her portfolio. Seems curious (loves exploring) and goal-directed as well (sets various goals for herself, for example making blue-dropping twinks, or getting exalted rep with a faction). Likes the world of WoW since she can do things there unencumbered by RL dangers.

Short-term memory: [#NS281115] Retains information for up to 30 seconds, generally involves neuronal networks in the cortex.

Shyness: [#Nett82] Shyness is often not associated with low extraversion, but with high neuroticism. [#Davidson110] Putting a shy child into a little bit anxious situation and support them, you're teaching her to cope. Supportive teaching & influential siblings can make children less shy; death of a parent more shy. [#NS200413] Shyness in trout does not seem to affect learning speed of threatening cues, but does affect forgetting; shy trouts are better at remembering threats.

Siblings: [#NS070913] The more older siblings someone has, the more likely he or she is to commit suicide.

Side effects: [#Pink14] We must also consider the side effects of our actions {EW: you can never do one thing}

Sidebands: [#Weng42] Asking yourself what was in your consciousness right now (usually is quite a lot!) First sidebands are usually more trivial, deeper sidebands more useful.

Sidis: [#Howe111] Bill Sidis never had a stable home life; both his parents were dominant and fought constantly. Stimulating? Yes. Supportive? No.

Signature strengths: [#Seligm37] Can be assessed using the VIA test [#EW] some similarities with Krekels. According to Seligman, when you exercise a 'signature strength', you feel ownership and authenticity, excitement while displaying it, rapid learning curve, sense of yearning to find more ways to use it, feeling of inevitablity (“try to stop me”), invigoration rather than exhaustion while using the strength, the creation and pursuit of personal projects that revolve around it, joy, zest, enthusiasm while using it. Exercising one of your signature strengths may also make you happier. [#Haidt97] if something is also your strength, you enjoy it more.

Silent neuron: [#Kluw39] A neuron is not only activated by its 'normal' input, but often also by neighbouring inputs, only sub-treshold. Usually, the normal input inhibits (by inhibitory neurons) the activation by weaker signals; however if the normal input ceases firing, other neurons can take over, resulting in the neuron responding to its 'non-natural' signal. {EW: maybe normal neuron: strong excitation, nearby neurons, average inhibition, far neurons, small excitation}

Silicon Valley: [#Robi125] A small location that stimulates the 'tribe' working there; lots of people (as well as diverse people) interested in computing in a very small area, so lots of contacts {EW: like the city effect}. [#Imagine195] Whereas big firms take secrecy seriously, in Silicon Valley there were lots of small companies, who had to collaborate on projects and exchange engineers. Also, noncompete clauses were almost never enforced in California, making quitting and reentering the job market easier. Also Homebrew Computer Club. Mapping period: allowing people to shout out questions, speculate on rumors, share future plans; then presentation of club member featuring a recent invention; finally random-access session, networking with strangers.

Similarity: [#Zill223] We pay closer attention and feel more sympathy for those who are similar to us in age, gender, or other characteristics. [#Nati40] It can be more difficult to learn a second language sound which is very similar but not the same as a first language sound, that it is to learn an entirely new sound. [#Greene83] Similarity may help to get funding; Alexander Malcolmson, from Scotland, had an unconventional streak and was a risk taker, so agreed to help Ford under Ford's conditions. [#Nass66] We are willing to ascribe almost any positive characteristic to people who are similar to ourselves/share personality characteristics with us. [#Nass72] Danger that we hire people like ourselves, diminishing workplace diversity. [#Nass88] The more unusual and coincidental the similarity seems, the better. Even making and using neologisms together increases similarity and hence liking/identification. People think harder about information gained from their own team, and remember more of it. Unafilliated comments are midway. [#Nass134] Happy drivers feel and perform better with happy voices accompanying them; sad drivers with sad voices; perhaps because dealing with emotions of others unlike your own takes much more processing time. Also, lack of empathy is hurtful if other remains happy.

Simon, Herbert: [#Strien263] Was a good networker with keen political sense, willing to make bold predictions (even if he could not achieve them) and was able to steer his research in the direction for the Nobel prize for economics. Was definitely not a modest man.

Simons, Sylvana: [#PsychMagazine] Generally plows through trouble instead of getting discouraged/depressed by stacks of bills. Has presentation coach (so seeks improvement even though she has a job already. Loves getting attention. Strong personality: moved out when boyfriend hit her, or when father commanded her (but was smart enough to move to sister and learn everything about the city to survive as good as possible] Likes to play/experiment, shaving her head one day completely and wearing a wig another time.

Simple: [#Burkem59] Simple doesn't mean 'easy'  -simple may be having few rules, but not easy means that for example it is hard not to get distracted.

Simplicity: [#Watt257] Simplicity is extremely useful when teaching. [#Supermemo] Simplicity, together with placement (many and right connections) determine how fast and how well we learn. [#Zuckerman129] Fermi seemed to reason very simply, but in reality the simplicity was the result of careful preparation and deliberate weighing of different alternatives to presentation. [#Hooked71] Elements of simplicity: time, money, physical effort, brain cycles [mental effort & focus], social deviance, non-routine.Identify user's scarcest resource at the moment of usage. What is the simplest action a user can take, and how can you make it more likely/useful?

Simulator: [#EricB253] Simulators can be useful for training, though mainly in the first phases of training (afterwards the gains in transfer are less), and seem less time efficient (but often more moneyefficient!) [#Clar256] There are conceptual simulators (clarifying a process) and operational simulators (for training tasks). Note that operational simulators can be too complex for novice learners (mental overload), and one can use training wheels (making a part of the interface unresponsive), hints, part task drill and practice when applicable. [#Clar273] Simulations work best when they start with simple exercises and move on to more complex ones, use explanatory feedback, avoid timing features unless automaticity is required, and keeping the interfaces simple and concrete, especially for novices. [#Hatt231] Simulations work best for low-ability students and for higher grades, however are never spectacular.

SINALOA: [#Schafer28] Safety in numbers and law of averages; some attempts will fail (necessarily) but having many attempts lets the law of averages work for you. Don't be discouraged by periods that are 'less successful' – they should exist, according to the law of average, and persevering is key.

Singing: [#NS130713] Singing in a choir increases individual heart rate variability (healthy), also fluctuates in synchrony with heartbeat (soothing)

Single parent: [#Csik150] There are relatively few talents from single-parent households – because cultivating talent may require the emotional and material support of more than one adult?

Sistine chapel effect: [#Coyl129] Being reminded of your field all the time and seeing the excellent performances therein. Living in a field-filled world, like Michelangelo did, and the Curaçao kids do. {EW: if your goals are far or you are barely reminded of how important it is (science-yearning kids) it is harder to be motivated. You're interested in what your neighbour is doing; proximity and familiarity increase perceived importance} {but doesn't accommodation occur, that the talent things don't seem obvious after a while because they fade into the background?} [#GladT212] Trends generally only become mainstream if people are confronted with it everywhere (music, ads, TV, arts, fashion) [#http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/08/AR2010060800999.html] Can also be because people ask you, for example if you'd like some fruit or fruit juice with your lunch?

Situated cognition: [#vBru17] The theory that learning is more efficient/effective in authentic situations with social interactions (like the horse market).

Situation assessment: [#EricB409] Experts seem to spend more time assessing the situation, relative to novices who spend more time deciding on the course of action.

Situation evocation: [#Nett46] If your behaviour (say, disagreeableness) evokes behaviour in the other that exaberates your own behaviour.

Situation selection: [#Nett46] If your personality determines part of where you are at a certain point in time (extraverts at parties), you will have other opportunities (casual sex) and behave in ways that are not really because of your personality, but because you're there. Contrast to situation evocation.

Situations: [#HeaB2] People eat more popcorn if you give them bigger containers. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem, to change behaviour you generally need to change the situation. [#Sommers17] We look right past situations, like a museum visitor does not notice the picture's frame. [#26] We chronically underestimate the influence of situations, people rating the stance of Castro on those who were assigned to write pro-Castro at 4.4, and those assigned to write against Castro at 2.3. Advertisers also use it, since you forget that the endorser just told it because they get money for it. [#32] Even if mock juries KNOW that a confession was not voluntary and say that it would not influence their judgement, they still are 4x as likely to convict the defendant. (Oh yes, and the police can make up evidence to make you confess). When we're tired, busy, or under time pressure, we're particularly likely to lack the mental strength needed to see the context (like seeing videotape of woman talking about sexual fantasies). Usually, we automatically leap to WYSIWYG. [#36] We can more easily recognize the impact of context on people we already know well, and definitely for our own behaviour. Note that children all over the world look at individuals and contexts similarly, it's the adults that have diverging opinions (West: personality-based explanations, east: situations). Trick: try to see things from another's shoes; If you're a teacher, follow classes of someone else. [#58] Since situations are often ambiguous, we calibrate our own responses to the reactions of others. [#87] If we see atrocities, it's often not that the apples are bad, it's that the barrel itself is rotten.

Size: [#Int130511] Silicon Valley is as big as the Netherlands (and 2.4 million people live there, a seventh of employees works in the tech sector)! That may help explain the scale of innovativeness. [#Int180512] Bigger pictures AND bigger letters give more emotional impact: size matters in itself {like mnemonicists have known for a long time} [#SellHuman27] Small organisations are fundamentally different from large organisations, there is less specialisation. [#Weiner156] Small places may help innovation, perhaps due to less specialisation, or due to being more likely to direct their eyes outward, more likely to ask questions, more likely to try harder, and riddled with doubt.

Skills: [#EricB47] Skills are almost always 'domain-specific', even doing calculations generally only works in the normal context a person applies it to. Any abstraction and transfer to other situations is hard (hence the card AB96 -problem being very hard). One could roughly say that the brains contain a number of scenarios and appropriate algorithms, and rarely if ever any 'loose'/abstract algorithm that is applied over many different scenarios. {EW: perhaps that is also why understanding IS a kind of knowledge; facts and procedures are probably not neatly separated in the brain} [#StolB54] Test for lack of skill is “if you put a gun to their head, can they perform as desired?” [#More17] Skills tend to occur in skill sets, and have a hierarchical structure. [#CoyleT17] Skills can be hard or soft: hard-skills: force, precision, repeatable, robot-like (reaction is right). Soft skills: are about reading, recognizing and reacting (right reaction). Learning hard skills: careful, slow, keenly attuned to errors. Soft skills by playing and exploring inside challenging, ever-changing environments. Always seek new ways to challenge yourself. Make high number of varied repetitions, and get clear feedback. After each session: what worked, what didn't, and why? Of course, many fields are a mixture of hard and soft skills. Coyle recommends focusing on hard skills first.

Slaves: [#Weiner70] “Many of us are slaves of life” [in contrast to understanding life and enjoying it]

Sleep: [#NS020213] Sleep has three phases. People with depression tend to spend less time in slow-wave sleep and more time in REM and phase I sleep. Slow-wave sleep may diminish connectivity across the board, while keeping relative strenghts intact (so to prevent excessive strengthening of synapses over time). Facial warming sends people to sleep. If volunteers are kept awake for 29 hours, their white blood cell count soars. Stage 1: 5-15 minutes, boundary between sleep and wakefulness; then transition to stage 2, usually with “hypnic jerk”, falling sensation with violent twitch. Relaxation makes stage 2 sleep ideal for naps; about 20 minutes, restores fatigued muscles and replenishes alertness; if you're awakened during stage 2, you feel refreshed. Awakened during stage 3 is hard; stage 3 does most of the restorative stuff (hormones, repair, immune system). Stage 3 cycles last about 60 minutes at first, diminish throughout the night, increasingly being replaced by REM-sleep. [#NS] Turn off your computer and such at least half an hour before going to bed. [#NS280505] Even normal people with 2 hours more sleep perform much better on tasks requiring sustained attention, like exams. [#Imagine107] After sleeping, about 60% of people were able to discover a secret pattern; with just mulling on it for a few hours, this was only 20%. [#Higbee44] If people go to sleep immediately after learning they remember more; but if they learn after sleeping they remember less. [#http://www.intermediair.nl/magazine/20150108/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_term=feel_good&utm_content=2015wk02&utm_campaign=iw&e=1&m_i=w_1wWOX86lieIK6UnuMhojvjtTwQOTTDl0i09kLv_mXlkW3gFJGqcHA3NwAtB1ssSpxaSnNM8SAZdqXsRxetRfGkyOtwp#4] Starting work at 10 o clock is better than starting work at 9 o clock, people also sleep more (7.5 hour if starting at 10 o clock, 6 hours if starting at 6 o clock; less than 6 hours a night seems to be bad... American Academy of sleep  Medicine: 7-9 hours for adults) http://www.welingelichtekringen.nl/wetenschap/397588/de-werkdag-zou-om-10-uur-moeten-beginnen.html ; http://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-polls-data/white-papers/how-much-sleep-do-adults-need/page/0%2C6/ 7-8 hours per night seems optimal, though students can sleep a bit longer (to 8.5 h); non-daylight for half an hour before going to bed might help (experiment?)) Long reported sleep times are more often a sign of social isolation/depression, and may reflect time spent in bed more than actual sleep times. [#NS280516AnUsersGuideToSleep] Adults need 7-9 hours of sleep, less than 7 is usually bad. [#NS150717WhyPeopleSleepAtDifferentTimes] Elderly people waking up early may be an adaptation for group living in which almost always someone is awake. [#NS050817NightmaresLinkedToGettingMoreThan9HoursOfSleep]  Worrying about the future, or about doing things wrong, have the strongest link to the frequency and severity of nightmares. Also sleeping more than 9 hours a night may caus nightmares (more REM late at night). [#NS100617CutThatLieInShort] Social jetlag (how much your waking hours shift during the weekend) corresponds to extra risk of cardiovascular disease. [#NS141017Wake-up call: How a lack of sleep can cause Alzheimer’s] Current sleeping pills do not produce naturalistic sleep, and are associated with higher rates of mortality and cancer. During deep NREM sleep, glial cells shrink 60%, allowing the brain to expel 10 or 20 times more effluent/metabolic debris. [#NS160917SleepTherapyEasesDepressionAndParanoia] Sleepio, online cognitive behavioural therapy, helps people get more sleep as well as reduces hallucinations and depression levels.

Sleep deprivation: [#Wiki] Sleep deprivation tends to lead to higher alcohol intake, lapses of attention (microsleep, possibly other reasons as well), obesity (hormone imbalances?). {EW: perhaps higher alcohol intake to calm down the amygdala which cannot be controlled too well by the prefrontal cortex} [#Bron34] Sleep deprivation both depressed learning since it causes neurons to lose their plasticity, and makes the brain less able to absorb glucose from the blood, which especially hits the executive function hard. Problems with concentrating, impulse control, brain also 'perseverates', continuing a strategy that doesn't work. Sleep deprivation also hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala, making negative memories more easy to be remembered. [#NRC280213] Sleep can make implicitly learned knowledge (order of buttons) explicit, probably in the non-rem-sleep, though more effectively so with children than with adults. [#NS300515] After 3 or 4 days of 'light' sleep deprivation, people stop feeling tired, even as their real performance is still deteriorating. [#NS270517BrainStartsToEatItselfAfterChronicSleepLoss] the brain cells that destroy and digest worn-out cells and debris go into overdrive in mice that are chronically sleep deprived. In people, chronic sleep deprivation puts people at risk of Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders.

Sleep learning: [#Higbee44] Sleep learning only works in light sleep, and only when things don't require reasoning, and only as adjunct to daytime study.

Sleeping: [#Root] Linus Pauling developed the method of thinking hard about a problem before going to sleep, for several days. In a few weeks, a solution would come to him. [#Medi138] The hippocampus and activated regions in the cortex remain chatting during sleep, which probably consolidates the memory. Sleeping between series of exercises makes it easier (three times!) to come up with a hidden better method. Learning has many repetitions during sleep, and seems to be consolidating the data. [@Kluw102] Declarative knowledge consolidation takes place mostly during the SWS (slow wave sleep), procedural knowledge consolidation during REM. [#Bron34] The more you learn by day, the more you need to sleep. [#NRC030311] The alertness and reaction speed vary unpredictably after sleep shortage; normal most of the time, but occasionally very much delayed; it's like a gamble. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/%5Bfield_blog_ref-title-raw%5D/200910/in-defense-good-nights-sleep] Actually, 10 hours a day may be even better than our normal dose, at least for athletes. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2012/korter-slapen-beinvloedt-kinderbrein-anders-dan-volwassen-brein.html?utm_source=120515-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=korter-slapen-beinvloedt-kinderbrein-anders-dan-volwassen-brein&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Children, when sleep-deprived, don't suffer so much in attention and learning as adults do (though they have very little attention span anyway), but cognitive skills and behaviour deteriorate faster than in adults. [#Erard74] Girl who slept only 6 hours a night from age 11 to study more became frail and died at age 17 [due to lack of sleep or due to stress?]. p[#NS160716SolvingTheMysteryOfSleep] Sleep seems to weaken synapses, kind of pruning. May enhance learning capacity next day? Also seems to function to help the brain drain waste products.

Slipping: [#EricB359] After getting ones driver's license, most people (barring the self-conscious experts) slip out of their proper routines such as checking their mirrors frequently and braking on time.Note though that each situation requires different scanning patterns, experts CAN bend the rules a bit where it fits the situation. [#Volks] Same goes for students: students at the end of primary school spell better than they'll do at the end of secondary school.

Sloppiness: [#Hargit92] 'Limited sloppiness principle': Olah discovered carbocations by NMRing 'dirty' samples.

Slots: [#EricB178] Experts do not merely have more knowledge than novices and deeper understanding, they also know things that novices don't know that they don't know, 'slots' (such as susceptibility to diseases for trees). {the 'unknown unknowns' – questions you don't even ask}

Slow practice: [#EricB460] Would slow practice without imagining the upcoming note be an useless fetish?

Slowness: [#Seligm125] Can meditation and extensive deliberation of little text cultivate a natural slowness?

Small start: [#HeaB79] Starting small helps you get evidence that something works.

Small talk: [#SellHuman95] An important function of small talk may be to find similarities, similarities {especially unexpected ones – and we are more similar to other people than we think} help build relationships.

Smart creative: [#Schmid17] In contrast to traditional knowledge workers, who either specialized deeply in a niche or developed management (not technical) expertise through rotation [and procedures are installed to reduce chance of failure, smart creatives are not limited to specific tasks, are not afraid of taking risks or of speaking up, or having a ‘hands-on’ approach. Shift jobs a lot. Have other expertise (like business or creative) next to technical skills. Also difficult to manage.

Smartass: [#RobertoCortez] Deal with them by having all relevant information with you (so don't take their -usually too low- estimates, ask for investigation time first, provide them with end solutions, present alternatives, and giving them facts and direct answers. You may want to speak with the customer themselves, as you don't want all your information to come through the smartass's filter.

SMASHIN'SCOPE: [#Buzan/EW] Senses, movement, etcetera gives a greater impression of an impulse, making it easier to remember. May be cognitive shortcuts for greater importance of something (something that moves, may be able to eat you. Humour means: unexpected, so more informative than other things. Positive things have more informative value than things that fail, etc.)

Smells: [#Medi212] Smells can evoke memories, particularly emotional details and autobiographical memories. Note that smell signals do not need to pass through the thalamus first but go directly to parts of the brain to be processed. Smell may also enhance offline processing during sleep (sleeping with smell after studying with smell?) [#AcadBoekengidsSep12] Letting people smell a scent when they are given a problem and also when they are sleeping gives more inventive ideas [EW: but would a scientist who is fascinated by the idea have a similar marginal benefit?] Also seems to work for learning. Strikingly, people who smelled the scent while sleeping were also better at recognizing their best idea. [#NS181014AMysteryToSavour] People who have lost their sense of smell can describe their life as 'if looking through a window' and are more prone to decpression, possibly as their limbic system is robbed of some sensory input which can lead to emotion-related disorders.

Smile graph: [#Hooked21] Usage first going down, then up. Like for EverNote.

Smiling: [#Davidson34] Only when you smile with both your cheek muscles and your eye muscles you will get a greater left-side activation of the brain and you'll therefore feel happier. [#Nass131] If you smile, you have more friends on facebook, many of them smiling (extroversion?)

Smith, Hamilton: [#NRC230711] Nobel prize winner 1978, restriction enzymes. Studied maths and medicine. Was a doctor for 6 years, read books on genes and became interested in biochemical research.

Smugness: [#Greene74] Being smug, feeling superior to others, or 'knowing the truth already' prevents you from learning, and blinds you to the knowledge and truth others possess.

Snapshot: [NS021113MirrorMirror] Memories may form in two parts: autobiographical memories, which give context to an event, and 'snapshots' that have lots of details, but with little context. Dissociation may impair the formation of context-giving memories, without which the snapshots can return as flashbacks, like in PTSD. Interestingly, people who have trouble forming autobiographical memories also have a higher risk of PTSD.

Sniper training: [#Flourish52] Snipers are not trained to react well in adverse circumstances by teaching them tricks to reduce the effect of adversity, but by bringing them in adverse circumstances again and again so they can deal with it. {EW: does that work for school times?} Idea is that some days you will feel horrible, and you need to deal with it.

Snow: [#Pino36] 'Snowing landscape' in a jar or murky water help to concentrate yourself.

Social acceptance: [#Volkskrant040611, Roos Vonk] When Roos Vonk worked as coach, she noticed that the 'point of pain' was always “they don't think I'm good enough, I shouldn't be there, I don't matter.”

Social comparison: [#Lyubom117] Happy people judge their life to internal standards instead of by social comparison.

Social comparison theory: [#Zill44] The theory that we feel good about ourselves if others are less fortunate than we are, and vice versa. However, cannot explain the effect of tragedies. [#DeMoor21] 'Billijkheidstheorie' is based on the fact that we can't really objectively perceive whether our reward is reasonable for our efforts; if others get greater rewards for fewer efforts, we tend to be discontent.

Social connection: [#NS271110] Priming people to feel more socially connected (family holidays) makes one more likely to endorse the use of torture techniques such as waterboarding.

Social context: [#Strien230] Technical developments (and scientific discoveries/directions of research) cannot be properly understood while ignoring the social context of communities of science, competitors, companies, government, customers etc.

Social effects: [#NS110513SurvivalOfTheSociable,RobertSampson] Some neighbourhoods cope better with challenges such as heat waves than others. Key factors: extent of social cohesion among residents, and their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good ('collective efficacy') [#NS300515] Requiring login, displaying names and profile picture next to people you vote up (or down) reduced abuse by about 80%. But the downvotes made people more likely to post antisocial comments (retaliation to whom had downvoted you) – now downvoting statistics are hidden, only used by the admins to look at things.

Social facilitation: [#Nass11] In learning, when you feel confident, having other people around improves how well you learn and perform. If you feel insecure, having other people around makes you feel nervous and pressured so you don't learn as well. [#Nass146] Having other people around increases arousal (also: cyclists ride faster when there are others around).

Social grooming: [#Franzen49] Chimpansees spend lots of time and effort on social grooming/contacts, because their survival outside the community is limited.

Social hierarchy: [#NS240115 Health of nations] The lower down a social hierarchy an individual is, the higher the levels of stress hormones in their blood.

Social identity theory: [#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_theory] Basically, that people will try to enhance their status, either by getting into a high-status group, or by redefining values or comparing their group to different groups and thereby elevate the status of their group (and thus of themselves).

Social intelligence: [#Grin] Social intelligence uses different brain areas from cognitive intelligence, though one should not automatically call every skillset an 'intelligence'.

Social interaction analysis: [#EricB207] Mapping a network, can be useful to find experts ('if you have that problem, I'd go to Ted'). Of course, reputation may be somewhat independent from actual skill... {EW: may be useful for finding teacher/mentor?}

Social intuition: [#Davidson53] People who look at the eye region of a face tend to have stronger social intuition than people who look at the mouth.

Social isolation: [#RoadToExcel27] When social isolation is imposed, {or chosen} such as in prisons, concentration camps, being bedridden or being a shepherd in the mountains, some individuals develop extraordinary skills, such as calculating or a good memory, as deliberate measure to ward of boredom and aversive thoughts; by focusing their attention on self-designed tasks. [#Redirect126] Teen pregnancy is especially common if teens feel disengaged from their school and community, and feel alienated and socially excluded. Regular volunteer work can help. Teen Outreach (Volunteer work + classroom sessions to discuss experiences and issues related to teen development) gives teenagers more sense of autonomy and connection.(parents can do volunteer work too, gives a good example} [#NS011212] Social pain is processed in rather the same way as physical pain; the adolescent pain network is still developing, and shows a more exaggerated response to small slights and insults; though having a tight social network in this period mutes the sting of future rejections. Loneliness also damps down antiviral processes and ramps up inflammation (in groups, viruses abound; but when alone, bacterial infections are more likely). Adequate social connections increase longevity as much as no smoking/less drinking. ?May be able to decrease loneliness by being able to give support to others? For some reason, then less brain activation on threat and rejection. Pain killers like morphine or paracetamol can reduce pain of social isolation [EW: and alcohol?]. Physical pain can also make you feel lonelier. People with higher pain tolerance are also more tolerant of rejection; the version of the opiate receptor OPRM1 may also play a role. Some people with chronic pain also had more emotional abuse during their childhood. [#NS271110] Social isolation shortens lifespan in humans and fruit flies alike; the social brain can unravel over weeks and months of solitary confinement, making it harder to build relationships afterwards. [#NS130713] Social isolation is associated with an increased risk of death comparable to smoking, drinking too much alcohol, obesity or physical inactivity.

Social learning theory: [#Medsker214] Adults imitate admired human models and tend to repeat behaviours that are rewarded by others.

Social loafing: [#59sec110] In groups, most people do less than what they'd do alone, as the cost/benefit ratio is skewed (less praise when success, less blame when failure)

Social media: [#NS220717AloneInTheCrowd] The more people use social media, the lonelier they get. Social media seems the cause of a bad mood instead of its effect; mood is lowered, especially after looking at other people’s facebook profiles.

Social observation: [#BenhamSabayan230614] Benham observed his group and professor: what is important for supervisor (in any case got PhD cum laude). Saw PhD-study as time to improve his capacities.

Social order: [#Ster22] Science, creativity and genius are always 'dangerous' and disliked by some people because they can upset the social order with unintended, unpredictable consequences [much like evolution does not always lead to a great goal].

Social proof: [#Int01062012] People in which the mirror-neuron system is most strongly coupled to to the 'valuing' system are most jealous. [#Influence115] Third of six persuasion categories. Canned laughter works especially well for poor jokes. “Salting”(putting money in hat for queens-day) is a variation on it. Also possible for good purposes: seeing a child play with a dog greatly reduces fear of dogs in a child that is afraid of dogs, but seeing a wide variety of children play with dogs works even better. Doubt makes people spread the word and seek converts {sort of obtaining social proof for oneself}. So can substitute physical proof for social proof. Social proof is needed strongest in uncertain situations: even in a group, people will help when it is clear what the problem is and what needs to be done. Is hampered if the helper is in the company of strangers, makes them more anxious to be poised/sophisticated, and less able to see worry in faces of the others. But if you can get help, you can build social proof momentum. We're also much more likely to follow the lead of people similar to us. (so for children: do what other children of their same age do [EW: or a bit older? May depend on whether kids are uncertain that they can do so, like the author's son who learned to swim because another 3-year old also could do it; a 'peer leader' may also work better than an 'ordinary' peer in some cases]. Note the Werther-effect: people will kill themselves when people similar to them did; and in similar ways. [so newspapers may want to NOT elaborately publish such stories?]. People (including pilots) may however want to make it look like an accident, so many 'accidents' are actually suicides, and therefore more lethal than 'normal' accidents. Greater uncertainty also makes you more sensitive to social proof (mass suicide in Jonestown in Guyana). Protection against social proof: keep at least somewhat alert, see if some data seems inaccurate. After all, social proof can also backfire: can make even innocent errors (like in stock markets) snowball.

Social skills: [#Pau] Social skills are often important in life. Caring for people and keeping your end of the bargain can be very helpful in achieving your dreams. [#EricB426] Social skills are important for experts – in order to be perceived as an expert one needs to display high self-confidence (bluster?) as well as good communication and persuasion skills. [#NS290613] Would 'versu' help develop social skills, by helping people experiment with options and see things from the perspectives of others.

Social status: [#Franzen262] Depends on wealth, power and prestige (postive feelings/judgement of a person). [#Bregma109] Differences in status in a country result in more bullying, distrust of strangers, less quality in relationships, worrying more about how one is seen by others. Also hampers social mobility: chance of the American Dream is bigger in Sweden.

Social support: [#Franzen249] People with good social support suffer less from depression and also less from physical complaints; social support includes emotional support, informational support, material support (and positive judgements/appreciation?) Most people have 3 to 5 people in the inner social support circle. More than that yields relatively little extra wellbeing. [#SellHuman209] If you put stickers in the car that encourages passengers to speak up when the driver goes too fast, insurance claims drop by 2/3. “Make it personal (radiologist with photograph), make it purposeful. [#Hargit174] When Cram wanted to start a new line of research, he did not seclude himself in his laboratory, he talked about it to all whom would listen as if to challenge himself to going through with the changes in his research. [#Lyubom164] Social support groups for cancer patients boost natural killer cell activity, patients live on average 18 months longer.

Social world: [#HaidtH183] The social world has three dimensions: horizontal (how close you are to someone – liking), the vertical dimension (hierarchy), and a ‘depth’ dimension which corresponds to purity. [EW: thought that socially one had liking and competence. Hierarchy may also help. More than 3 dimensions for social physics?]

Social-economic status: [#Eyse126] Unexpectedly many geniuses come from middle-class or upper-middle class homes, especially professional-class homes. Motivation may be more important than income though (Jews). {security? GW Bush, Paris Hilton, W. Alexander, 'Valley Girl', type of peers, snotty doctors/lawyers who have high social skills (in THEIR world)}

Sociality: [#NS03032012] Chimps are as smart 3-year olds at most physical tasks, but in collaborating and sharing a representation and information with another individual, and in justly sharing rewards, 3-year olds are geniuses. Chimps tackle box problems alone, and fail, 3-year olds share sub-solutions and share the rewards, and succeed. [#NS17032012] Babies can distinguish objects and agents, and are far more interested in agents {perhaps that's why people like to 'work with people'}.

Socialization: [#EricB756] Socialization is the formation of identity, parents can be very effective in that when combining a high level of support with inductive control {EW: what is that, exactly?! Is it what I think it means?} [#Nelissen103] Socialization is not merely what parents tell a child to do, but also what the parents do. [#Strien185] Every era and culture has some 'whispering voices' that are put in the heads of people, which influence our view of reality. There have also been eras in which there was a large 'prestation motivation' in society. Advantage of those socialisations and outer-personal influences is pluriformity of ideas.

Socializing: [#Sidis] Some see schools as good opportunities to start ones network {EW: in the Netherlands this is mainly true for student associations at universities. But frankly, for most occupations not that much knowledge is needed} [#HaidtH133] When introverts are forced to be more outgoing, they usually enjoy it and it boosts their mood.

Society: [#EW/Sidis] Is it the aim of society to keep things “running smoothly” rather than educating people to think and thereby risking change? [#PaulWij] Society determines what is important (a talent) and what not. [#NS120113] One limit of small tribes is that there is often one hothead that breaks the armistice: without a strong leader, a tribal society can't enforce peace (perhaps one of the reason to tolerate 'parasites'). [#NS051111] Turchin: corruption perpetrated by elite group against majority of fellow citizens is indicator of mature state on verge of collapse.

Socio-emotional selectivity theory: [#NS020716OldMonkeysChooseToHaveFewerFriends] Older people spend less time on social activities, possibly because they don't find making new friends worth the time investment

Sociopath: [#KevinDuttonTheGoodPsychopath] Wat zou ik nu doen als ik niet zo gestrest was? Wat zou ik doen als er niets op het spel stond?’

Socratic method: [#Watt114] One person asks questions, other answers them. In Socrates' time it was often the teacher asking questions.{EW: I wonder though if it would not be more stimulating if the learner asks the questions and thereby directs the dialogue to his curiosity. But sometimes the teacher should lead the learner to new ground, even though I think that may better be achieved by evoking curiosity} [#Weng18] Socratic method means describing everything about an object or idea to a tape recorder or listener. Also used to train wine tasters (so would description give the 'importance'/rewards needed for learning?)

Software: [#Ster421/EW] Can software help people become more creative?

Solar activity: [#Eyse163] Creative periods seem to occur at low periods of solar activity (EW: in the small ice ages?)

SOLO taxonomy: [#inet] Five levels: pre-structural (learning loose elements), unistructural (simple connections, significance not seen), multistructural (relation to whole yet missed) and relational (see structure, how all parts fit into the whole). And extended abstract, applying the knowledge gained to other situations. Experienced vs expert teachers make students produce 29% vs 74% in the highest categories.

Solution diffusion: [#NS030813] Simon Berry found that 'ColaLife' was hard to distribute 'lifting' in packs of cola – much easier to have suppliers and retailers who all made money by reselling it.

Solution trap: [#Strien143/EW] Some solutions, while not wholly correct, may be easier to find than the true solution; this happened to Kepler who found an almost-right formula 10 years before finding the correct one.

Solution-focused therapy: [#HeaB34] If your problem were magically solved overnight, what would be the first small sign that the problem was gone? What would you be doing differently the next morning? Exception question: when was the last time you saw a little bit of miracle, even just for a short time?

Solutions: [#Redirect41] 'When there are multiple solutions to a problem, it's likely that none of them works' (like in self-help books)

Solving: [#RoadExcel14] Experts are often not so much rationally analyzing and solving problems as they are performing pattern-matching using problems/situations stored in their memory.

Sombrero-filter: [#Laird73] A typical way in which neurons work, where close-by neurons activate and farther-away neurons inhibit. {EW: and for ideas? And would an EA reward the size of the filter that gives the best/simplest ideas?}

Sommerfeld, Arnold: [#Seth2] In contrast to Planck, who found extensive and thoroughly proven mathematical foundations most important, Sommerfeld focused on a diversity to physical and 'real-life' problems to illustrate the approaches to solve them. Would sometimes even abandon the quest for a theoretical explanation, as long as a formula could be found that fit the data. May have been influenced by teaching for quite some time at one of the technical colleges. The “physics of principles” (Planck) vs the “physics of problems”. Interestingly, the 'physics of problems' was not shocked as much by quantum mechanics, as they treated the rules as 'whatever worked', not concerning themselves too much with the changing explanations for the formulas. Was called to Munich in 1906, which obliged Sommerfeld to not only lecture on diverse areas of theoretical physics, but also give special lectures on current questions. Was also known as an excellent teacher. He also incorporated his most recent work in his lectures. Lectures were in casual prose. He himself, while teaching, clearly attempted to master Planck's work published the year before. Sommerfeld had experience in and blended mathematics, physics and engineering. Was ardent supporter of electromagnetic worldview (so passion?). Emphasis on solution of specific problems, like wireless telegraphy or the wearing on ball bearings. Sought out, both in teaching and research, issues of contemporary interest [!EWRelevance] that he would then attempt to understand in theoretical detail.S.'s first work was for a prize essay, where he sought out (so sought help!) help from the institute interested in the problem for aid in evaluating the terms. Had a strong opinion on the mathematical abilities of physicists when young [and was not afraid to express it, at least to his mother], and considered himself a mathematician; happily becoming an assistant of Felix Klein. Refused assistantship with Waldemal Voight because he did not consider that his mission (mission was maths). Did not estimate Volkmann highly, but admired Hertz (so would have felt physics interesting anyway – and knew what was hot in physics, at least knew that half of the papers were following in Herz's footsteps) In 1908 was however very interested in what was important in physics at that time, perhaps partially led by the influence of the influential Lorenz. Explicitly tried to change fields; even requested an experimental laboratory [even if he lacked experimental skill himself] as that was considered required for physics. Or was a bit PR that he seemed to be doing so, for himself nor his students did much experimental work at all. Was in 1894 anxious that he was unable to do experiments and would make a fool of himself in physics [anxiety?]. Moved to Gottingen, the site of 'mathematical high culture' (in his own words). In 1893 family connections wound him up in the mineralogical institute, but his heart continued with maths. Klein helped him get a professor position at an engineering school, where they first mistrusted him (maths!) but Sommerfeld was soon found to be very helpful, and asked for lots of advice [ so he was a helpful person!] May have influenced Sommerfeld both because it was an early stage of his career, and because he was forced to adapt [EW: and perhaps Sommerfeld knew that he was not the best of mathematicians, but could be more successful in another field] Was politically minded, sometimes strove to prove that maths was useful, more than striving to solve the problem. Klein might have sought the 'salvation of maths', to keep it strong and independent. [EW: need for status (=importance?) and independence, from both mathematicians and engineers, did color the field] Sommerfeld might have felt similarly. However, as time passed, concentrated more and more on choosing the proper maths for a certain problem instead of a certain problem to demonstrate maths. Also became editor of the physics section of “Die Enzyclopaedie der mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss ihrer Anwendungen” Failed to pass on the job to his colleagues, but became introductory letter to great physicists like Bolzmann and Lorenz.Came to be connected to majority of mathematically minded professors in the German-speaking world. Only lectured on principles so that students had the tools to attack particular problems; focused mostly in his lectures and his research on particular problems. Topics were drawn from a wide range of sources. Aim was not to generate an 'universal physics', but to solve specific problems. Introduced students almost immediately to the problems in certain new fields. Corresponded to Lorenz! Told in lecture what was not known, and where the difficulties were. In his lectures, took different perspectives and 'physical worldviews'. Sommerfeld was selective, but neither exclusive or dogmatic. After deriving Planck's formula in his lecture notes, Sommerfeld immediately followed with a section 'critical remarks'. Kept an eye on physics literature (also on for example Ehrenfest's criticism of Planck's theories), was the first one teaching relativity theory. [EW: could wax lyrical and critical, loved his field and had strong feelings about it]. Also corresponded with Wien. Biographers of S have all remarked on both the number and eclecticism of both his problems and his methods. S. had also close interaction with those at the forefront of technology use and production (for example count Arco and a marine officer) Had “warmhearted and fundamentally decent attitude”. Sommerfeld had access to large selection of students who were intellectually moved and not merely bent on money-making, physicists 'with body and soul' [also because Munich was such a nice city to live in]. First candidates were drawn by Sommerfeld's skill as a lecturer in mathematics, experimental physics, and other fields [so was good lecturer, and broad knowledge]. S was able to have a really well-provided institute. Leo Graetz, also at the insitute, was also a brilliant teacher, but attracted/handled the students for whom physics was more a requirement – Sommerfeld was able to dedicate his time to the few students who wanted more. Required that students had had at least 3 semesters of calculus and such. Clear, carefully prepared lectures with a slow, halted diction, giving students the impression that he was working through the problems himself as he spoke, rather than offering well-worn physical truths. Lectures well-illustrated with figures, with his large, firm handwriting. Sommerfeld would point out the places where the theory was still uncertain, in order that a student would know that his failure to understand was due to a deficiency in the state of science and not in his reasoning ability”. Classes met in the morning 4x per week for lectures. followed by 2 hours devoted to the solution of problems [EW once per week 2 hours, not 4x a week 2 hours I guess]. More advanced topics, often linked with Sommerfeld's research, were discussed in 2-hour seminars held weekly. Believed strongly in problem-solving exercises to supplement any text. The 2-hour problem solving: Sommerfeld asked Debye to set the questions, asked students to step to the blackboard to demonstrate their method of solution and interrupted to suggest improvements. Kind of dialogue between the assistant, Sommerfeld, and the student at the blackboard. Took about 15 minutes per problem, two or three were discussed in detail each week. Session ended with distribution of problems for next week, to be solved at home before the next session. Sommerfeld demanded clean mathematics, but not so much mathematical virtuosity than relating the maths to the physical problem. Students could already differentiate and integrate, they mainly learned with him how to formulate the initial equation for a physical problem. [EW: is start!] Note that in Sommerfeld's time, training students through exercises and examples was new! Sommerfeld did not teach general rules, but that there was always some 'trick' you can use to solve the problem. He would say “this is a problem that has rotational symmetry”, but then would not say “now consider the group of rotations”, but “therefore it's a nice trick to take polar coordinates”. Did not go into the theory why one trick worked and another didn't, still students got a kind of instinctual feeling for what tricks to apply in which situations. Seminars: Sommerfeld was selective, only 5 to 10 were admitted. Sommerfeld set the general topic, students were expected to provide most of the content, giving prepared talks on original research or on papers in the field. Listed as “lectures by the participants on (relativity/etc.)” Were held every two or three weeks. Would pass a paper to a student and say “here's a paper of Mr. Kramers, you give a talk at the seminar next week and explain to us what Kramers actually means by this paper and what you think about it.” Required every member of the class to give a talk on Schrodingers wave equation. Was however not casual in judging problems, not hesitating in telling students that they had clearly failed to understand the central point of the paper or at least to articulate that point in a meaningful manner. Seminars were kind of intermediate step between lectures and PhD research. And no two students were assigned the same talk. Was overlap in the form of the seminar & form of the exercises: everything was done explicitly including all the algebra. Debye also instigated a students-only seminar, where students could bring everyone up to speed on issues that came up in the daily discussions of the more senior students. But no professors, as they wanted to be free to be as stupid as we wanted to be. Sommerfeld had lectures earlier in the morning, and from 9:00 to 13:00-13:30 the students were sitting in his 'seminary', having discussions, and during that time people were called in by Sommerfeld. Almost every morning, but definitely every second morning, someone was called in by Sommerfeld, to tell him what he had tried in his own work, what he thought about a certain paper, and so on. [And to suggest some work to do, of course]. Sheer number of hours Sommerfeld spent with his students was striking. Even had lunch with them in Cafe Lutz, scribbling formulas with pencil on the marble. Over half his day was therefore in the company of his pupils. [!Also Sommerfeld himself solved problems by chewing them over with his students and his surroundings – so used distributed cognition quite well, and was probably also a role model in that regard] In the seminary, the students tried to hear the latest developments and tried to analyze the problem together. Sommerfeld was conservative, formal and strict, but gentle, a bit paternalistic.But when discussing a problem, he was less formal, treating students as equals, giving the impression of two equals talking about a most vital and interesting problem. Invited students to his house, from 8 pm, would talk about physics to 11 or 12 pm.  Used them as sounding boards. Irregular, about twice a week or so, whenever he felt the need to talk about something. In his own words “personal instruction in the highest sense of the word is best based on intimate personal acquaintanceship. Ski trips with my students offered the best opportunity for that). Often those trips were also with professors and students of nearby institutes. Sommerfeld had a list of problems that his students could select for his thesis; each with its own merit and its own mathematical technique. Often sought out phenomena that occurred (in different shapes) in many forms in nature (so natural for analogical thinking, or for finding important, core problems to study?).S could be businesslike in declining the offer to write a textbook with Planck. [#8] Both Sommerfeld and Planck strove to understand and incorporate one anothers methods and insights. #9 Was flexible in his approach: tried Bohr's example at first, but switched to trying to get phenomenological descriptions after a few years of futile attempts.[#15] Would the 'physics of problems' prepare his students for creativity as they felt free to experiment with different abstractions (views) of the problem, trying out different approaches, and mastering a vast range of techniques to increase their flexibility? [#64] Students 'normally' learn to solve normal problems, so they can recognize them in different contexts and solve them there (medium/far transfer) [EW: more pattern recognition than rote learning of formulae] The seminars let students themselves take the lead in proposing research and solving minor problems. Note that the competition between Sommerfeld's students was not as big as in Cambridge, were rankings were made and were made public. Neumann's discipline led students to pay most attention to the techniques itself, instead of seeing it as a tool to study physics problems (fine-tuning technique  -goal displacement). Hopf: had a burning hunger for physics [perhaps also due to the hecticness of the army]. Sommerfeld also signed a manifesto boycotting English scientists [?political move?]. Also corresponded with Paul Ehrenfest. Sommerfeld also corresponded with his graduated students (and they with him). Was integral part in many of the discussions at the first Solvay conference. [#144] Wanted to understand the physical world, not just find formulas that fit. Wanted to formulate hypotheses proactively to see which would work. Kept in touch with Emil Wiechert. Also responded to papers of others, like those of Johannes Stark. Was not too stubborn to incorporate relativity and quantum mechanics, and saw the latter as the one most interesting and under debate.

Song dynasty: [#Weiner69] The Song dynasty was also very innovative. Centered around Hangzhou, which was also a port and trading city.

Sorkin, Aaron: [#Robi92] Playwriter, fell in love with acting, but when he accidentally started writing (he was bored), he found that he really got flow from writing, he realized that while he had visited many plays, he loved the stories much more than the acting.

Sound: [#Int210912] Sound (even sea sounds) have a sort of self-medication effects: they can change the level of arousal. However, if there is text, or unexpected changes, or the sounds are unfamiliar, cognitive performance may decline.

Soundbites: [#Syed126] Soundbites and quotes may help drill in a message: “Nobody got anywhere in life without working hard, by showing tremendous discipline, and by taking responsibility for their actions. That's what separates the best from the rest.”

Sounding board: [#Howe99] Faraday had a sounding board in a friend whom he wrote letters {EW: so did Einstein!}[#Robi120] As John Wheeler said “If you don't have a sounding board, you're bound to lose the way.”

Space measures (historiometry): [#SimonB16] Easy to calculate and very reliable / consistent between reference works. However, have biases, preferring short-lived geniuses {EW or likely any other person with a dramatic story}. Alternatives are to survey experts, or to look at citations/performances of the works.

Spaced learning: [#Medi100] Much better than massed learning. [#Wiki] But no spacing effect found in incidental learning {unless the incidental learning is semantically analyzed}. Main difference may be that perceptual priming (context the same) weakens the impact of the second association in massed learning; rotating unfamiliar faces eliminated the spacing effect; so perhaps massed learning with suffiently diverse representation may be effective too... [#Hatt186] Spaced practice enhances both acquisition and retention. Usually 3 or 4 exposures over different days are enough. For simple tasks, relatively brief rest periods are sufficient, more complex tasks may need 24 hours of rest or more. {EW: and spaced rewards may work better because they become more unpredictable/unexpected, and hence stronger?} [#Will120] An additional advantage of spacing is that it makes learning tasks less boring!

Spatial contiguity principle: [#Clar132] Students learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented near each other rather than far from each other on a page or screen. A related principle is that you should not try to split attention between computer screen and manual – try to put the instructions on the computer screen as well; this is especially important for complex tasks.

Speaking: [#Nati2] Speaking and writing are more useful for language acquisition than reading and listening as they force learners to focus on words.

Special: [#Bloo489] The more special and accomplished pianists thought themselves to be, the greater the motivation for accomplishment. The more special their parents thought them to be, the greater their investment in their child. {a bonus of the talent myth?}

Specialists: [#NRC221212] In the 19th century, it were the specialists (doctors, pharmacists) who warned against poisonous pigments, the public and government didn't really care overmuch.

Specialization: [#Eyse45] Would specialisation in current science preclude the title 'genius' since that requires some kind of universality? {EW: and would the project-swapping Pauling be as successful now?} [#Ster375] One side effect in companies is that most supervisors don't understand the proposals for improvement of their more knowledgeable subordinate, hampering innovation. [#EW} Specialisation can inhibit learning; what Ingrid learned about SNPs is not fed back to me who did the filtering since she didn't discuss it with me. [#Nass165] Specialisation can work wonders for your expertise, even 'specialist televisions' that 'only show comedy'. Also evokes halo effect (not only more newsworthy, but also better visual quality)

Speculation: [#Greene189] Many scientists are afraid to speculate since it seems unscientific and subjective, failing to understand that it is a necessary part of the experimental cycle.

Speech: [#Foer123] Cicero thought that the best way to remember a speech was not word for word, but point for point, using memoria rerum. [#NRC241112] Surprise, preferably with images (general coming up with gun), 2. Involve your audience (ask them to do something, like providing an estimate). 3. Tell stories. 4. Focus on the feeling you want people to have (not just facts) 5. use humor. 6. Converse with your audience, as if you're speaking with friends. 7. Focus on giving, not taking (what do you want to give the audience, don't seek approval), 8. Forget the paper. 9. Make contact with your audience (eye contact) 10. Be stable and just move on purpose. [#Nass177] You seem more intelligent if you talk fluently (appropriate pausing), avoid uh..'s, ehm..s and valley girl speak ('like'), also moderately emotional speech. [#Evans41] Human speech is possible because (unlike chimps) we have a lower vocal box, hyoid bone (for tongue movement), and greater working memory.

Speed: [#Weng186] Would one not get interference of one's own judgment if one generates ideas quickly? [#Scho42] Haste is bad. Doing things with a tad of speed and energy, however, is very good practice!

Speed reading: [#RoadExcel3] Speed readers can read fast, but they don't understand what they read. [#NS080314] Tool named Spritz may help people read faster.

Spiral learning: [#http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Review/EDUCAUSEReviewMagazineVolume40/NextGenerationEducationalSoftw/157961] Teaching children the same concept, on progressive times in the curriculum, in increasing levels of sophistication.

Spiritual faith: [#NS] Scoring high on 'spiritual faith' seems to help people survive advanced lung cancer longer.

Spirituality: [#Flourish149] Higher levels of spirituality are assocated with greater well-being, less mental illness, less substance abuse, and more stable marriages (and better military performance). [EW: chicken and egg?]

Splitting information: [#http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm] Dividing a complex tangle of facts into pairs of relationships helps retention, as you uncouple the linkings and don't need to rehearse the easy items as often as the difficult ones.

Sports: [#Root] Running seems the only activity impacting impact ratio. Walking, sailing, tennis and surfing help the citation cluster {EW: more oxygen to brain versus more time to get ideas? Impact ratio=quality (cit#/public#), citation cluster is more the #cit total {productivity/number of ideas?}. High C, low I gives more creativity, high I, low C better selection}. Number of physical activities, and having physical activities that can be continued into old age, both help. {EW: I thought most sporters are quite boring though – a difference with science, where people need to know lots of things to be creative?} [#Colv9] Performance in sports seems to be increasing due to better training methods. May be easier than in science since track times and such are much easier to measure. [#Csik92] Talented teenagers spend less time at sports and games. [#Syed262] Sports are an objective arena, where blacks had more chance to be judged fairly than in the marketplace (-50% less chance for an invite compared to 'white' resume), so making it a natural focus for one's efforts. Though actually, the racial bias (blacks are intellectually inferior but athletically gifted) can also help them via a more biased/positive perception by coaches, leading to a Matthew effect. [#HoweX414] Investigations on Olympic athletes failed to find any heritable components to athletic top performance. Height seems the only unmodifyable determining factor. [#Franzen230] Young people have a greater desire to do sports [#EW: more need for stimuli?] [#RoadToExcel29] Caloric usage by professional sporters is even outside the range of labor-intensive hunter-gatherer cultures {EW: suggesting that we have not evolved under such extreme circumstances, and that our bodies may have trouble adapting/staying healthy} [#NS040513] Ratio between type-two (fast twitch) and type-one (slow-twitch) is almost fixed, and helps determine success in different sports. VO2 (which has a genetic maximum) and levels of blood cells/hemoglobin also have some influence.

SQ3R: [#Parr50] Survey, question, read, recite, review; a method for studying texts. Survey: take a proper look at the text; question: think of questions you want the text to answer/think the text answers. Recite = briefly summarizing what you've read. You could add 'reacting', namely: how to apply this knowledge, what are the counterarguments?

SSRIs: [#HaidtH40]  Prozac works after 5 weeks or so. But can also make it hard to remember names and facts. Can help against depression, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, social phobia, some eating disorders, and OCD

Stability: [#Medi185] A stable home helps grades, a home where the parents have open conflict hurts them {Support?}. Stabilizing a parent's marriage (Gottman's techniques) makes children regulate their emotions more healthily.[#EW] would stability/predictability/safety in a home environment foster the ability to delay gratifcation and thus promote studying? [#Eyse136] Even top scientists often come from broken homes, have had physical handicaps, bad relationships with their parents... [Because parents had high P? Because high P children were difficult to handle?]

Stability bias: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/everybody-is-stupid-except-you/201108/how-grandparents-unlock-kids-learning-potential] Stability bias: the assumption that we know as much in the future as we do now, ignoring future learning and future forgetting {EW: would that make us see geniuses as geniuses, instead of people who spent a great amount of time practicing}

Stach: [#EW] The main character in Jan Terlouw's book “How to become king”, Stach was raised by his uncle Gervaas to be as frank as possible, only being admonished if he didn't dare to do something.

Stages: [#GiftednessMusicPres] Sampling stage ->[identity formation]->specializing stage ->[musical prioritization] ? investment stage-> [expertise at professional level] ? maintenance stage.

Stance: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200908/the-self-control-costs-moral-flexibility] Having a principled stance on some behaviour (such as that smoking or lying is always bad) trains you to require less willpower, as it becomes automatic.

Standard Operating Procedures: [#Kluw9] SOP is a theory of automated processing, positing that neurons can exist in three states, inactive, A1 and A2. I->A1->A2->I. Two stimuli in A1-> learning occurs. CS makes US-neuron in A2; so no learning if the result is expected. Also would explain spaced learning effects, as the US would have been decayed to A2; and A1(CS)+A2(US) may even result in inhibitory learning!

Standards: [#Dwec194] Great teachers have high standards, but do help students to achieve them (love, and telling the how, next to lots of hard work). [#EricB690] Standards have become higher, in any case in sports and music, because practice methods have improved. Olympic swimmers from a century ago would not even make it into current high school swimming teams! [#Jessim] Holding high standards without a supportive, warm environment is merely harsh, a warm environment without high standards unstimulating.[#Robi125] High standards are part of Silicon Valley's culture. {and of the parents of most successful students}

Stardom: [#Tonn61] Stars have 'presence', eyes turn towards them {EW: enormous self-confidence?}. Also, they need to not care about anyone else's opinion, and surround themselves with the right people.

Starters: [#ReadExcel11] Starting later to learn a skill generally decreases the learning time, but ten years still often the minimum.

Staszewski: [#EricB252] A psychologist who uses expert systems to decompose expert knowledge to train novices more effectively.

Statistical learning: [#NRC280204] Babies can learn, due to innate statistical learning, whether a word is strange, and even word borders! However, only works for subsequent words/syllables, XqY does not teach the relation between X and Y. Babies also overgeneralize in a noisy (error-containing) environment; if input is wrong 40% of the time, output is wrong only 10% of the time, for example. {could the non-full search be related to the sharpening? After all, with more hypotheses, sharpening would have a harder time occurring}

Statistics: may be bad for grasping causal relationships. See Judea Pearl. Pioneered a “causal structural model”, and causal discovery algorithms, also for genes. “Causal stability ranking” http://stat.ethz.ch/Manuscripts/buhlmann/cstar.pdf

Status: [#McK/EW] Status is awarded to anything that is hard to achieve, and takes talent and/or great dedication (not like winning the lottery). Longer education also gives higher status. [#Hobbelt] We don't need stuff, we need status. [#Hargit5] Nobel prizes may have status since princes attend it [EW: so something gets status if 'certified' high status individuals pay attention to it] [#Tiggelaar/PacelleVanGoethem] Keeping head still and speaking slowly with a low voice makes it more likely that your opinion prevails. [#Susski27/EW] Limiting entry gives status.

Stealing: [#CoyleT10] Steal like crazy – imitate top performers in your field. What, exactly, are the critical moves here? How do they perform those moves differently than I do?

Steitz, Thomas Arthur: [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368_supp/full/478S2a.html] Nobel-prize winning biologist, was mediocre in school until starting to compete with younger brother; driven to his reseach by his curiosity, not because of winning Nobel prize or desire to serve humanity. Was also keen musician and chorister.

STEM: [#NS211213_MichaelBrooks] Wages in engineering are not rising, glut of science PhDs, many relegated to donkey work in job.Best of 80,000 employees were those with good communication and thinking skills. Ability to think broadly, and read and write clearly. 44% of STEM minors shifts to other major (30% in humanities), in health care and computer science, shift is 59.2%.

Steps: [#Clar260] When starting out, use very specific instructions, such as 'move the mouse cursor to the start of the first word', but later in training use more general instructions, such as 'replace the text … by …' This helps generalization and moderate-transfer.

Stereotype threat: [#Syed266] White golfers put less well when thinking their natural athletic ability is being tested; {EW} as do girls with maths/physics, and blacks with intellectual activities in general. Can however be reversed by making the person feel positive about themselves and their values, instead of focusing on their race/gender/'weakness'. [#Redirect222] Positive effect of stereotype threat if your group is perceived to be better. 'Stereotype lift', though it's effect seems to be smaller than that of stereotype threat. [#Nass174] Stereotype threat or identifying with your 'outgroup' diminishes if you're not the only person from your group, or if there is cooperation/interdependence within the group. Even though for some stereotypes represent a challenge to triumph over. [#Sommers157] Women do poorly on maths tests after being shown ads depicting girls as fixated on boys and shopping; but there is no gender difference after they watch commercials about intelligent and articulate women.

Stereotyping: [#Nass7] Stereotyping also works in education; participants who heard the female voice said that the computer taught 'love and relationships' more effectively [EW: but was that perception or also effect?] [#Sommers250] We stereotype more when we're tired, overworked or frustrated. So morning people discriminate more in the evening, and it's the other way around for evening people. [#NS260915] Stereotyped attitudes can be diminished by stimulating the medial prefrontal cortex.

Stickiness: [#SciAmMindNov11] Pictures of landscapes are seldom memorable; pictures were more memorable if people see something in it they recognize. Next to that, strangeness, funniness, or interestingnes. People help, as does implication of movement, as do human-scale objects like cars and chairs [we can interact with]

Stimulate: [#EW] Would a stimulating home environment stimulate learning, because either achieving knowledge is associated with joy, or because a student has many more hooks which makes studying much more pleasurable?

Stimulating: [#Robi174] Ken Robinson's wife always liked reading, but was incredibly inspired by the nun who gave her Yeats to read (and loved teaching).

Stimulation: [#EW] Some people may need more stimulation than others (so difference between set point and natural point). That stimulation can be intellectual (myself: programming versus analytical chemistry), physical (sports), general arousal (sky diving) or whatever.[#NS051215RunnersJointsSelf-HealOnTheGo] The brains of ultra-marathon-runners shrink by 6%, which may be because of lack of visual stimulation by running 64 days on roads.[#Eyse133] Stimulation in the parental home may be important, but there are counterexamples: Wagner, Berlioz, George Washington Carver. [#NS090714, Idle minds succumb to temptation of electric shocks] 67% of men and 25% of women prefer to self-administer somewhat unpleasant shocks to doing nothing but think for 6 to 15 minutes.

Stimulus: [#?] The human brain is always searching for stimuli, but having the same stimulus for a longer time leads to habituation.

Stochastic resonance: [#NS021010] Noise in a system increases sensitivity of a switch [EW: would that help increase creativity in schizphrenics?]

Stockholm syndrome: [#Pers12] We pay more attention to/obey and try to please a person who has the power to hurt us.

Stopping: [EW/Els Das] I may not always know when to stop – I could do with some finer sense of people's specific sensitivities, for example. Still, looking at the men at the balloon-blowing experiment: you may fail, but you'll learn much more. Watson's rule of thum #4/5: don't be afraid to fail hard.

Storage: [#Kluw73] We may store 'what' and 'where' information of the same object in different parts of the brain. [#Kluw118] Storage is not necessarily the same as the primary input modality: words get to the 'word' region in working memory, whether they are given in text or by ear. {so what would happen if you tried to visualize or audiolize or kinesthenicalize words/concepts?}

Storage strength: [#http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all] Storage strength is how 'deep' a memory is in the brain, retrieval strength is how easily it is accessed. In repeating, the more easily an item is accessed (the higher its restrieval strength) the less storage strength is enhanced.

Story: [#EW] A story alternates higher and lower arousal, making for a pleasant and captivating experience. May be similar to learning, stories evolving from the pleasure gained by learning.(like playing?) [#Jaff2] Even stories about failures can encourage, if the goal is grand [still a kind of role models if they're sympathetic]; Trevisano listened to his grandfather's stories about alchemists, and was determined to succeed where they failed. [#Will67] Willingham sees story as having four C's: causality, conflict, complications and character [shown by action rather than telling] Stories can be killed by giving too much information. For teaching works best when inferences for story are medium to diffcult.

Story event: [#McKee33] A meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a value. (which is more utilitarian than moral or ethical: hope/despair is also a dimension of value). Note that for storytelling, a story event should be achieved by conflict (so not coincidence, that it rains). Every scene is a story event (movie=40 to 60), and a value has to change from positive to negative [preferably cut exposition scenes] Note that scenes can go over several places, but are still one scene if the change in value is continuous. A “beat” is a part of a scene, a couple of action-reaction (tease-tease). (insult -insult is next beat). [so different attitude/approach in a beat?] Sequence is 2 to 5 scenes, which end with a bigger change (like overarching goal: the job). Act is series of sequences which ends with an even bigger reversal. Story ends with absolute and irreversible change. This is also the archplot:  active protagonist struggling against primarily external forces of antagonism to pursue his or her desire, through continuous time, within a consistent and causally connected fictional reality, to a closed ending of absolute, irreversible change. Miniplots try to take away from the archplot, antiplots rebel against the rules. Open ending: one or more questions unanswered, emotions unfulfilled. Internal conflixt vs external conflict, single vs multiple protagonists ['multiplot'], causality vs coincidence [role of coincidence usually much greater in miniplot or antiplot], consistent vs inconsistent realities. Without change: “nonplot” (McKee doesn't call that story, even though it can touch us). Politics: Hollywood vs Art film. Hollywood: optimistic about potential of life to change – especially for the better.n Archplot, very high percentage of positive endings. Don't strive for fashionable or commercial endings, but truthful endings. Story: “I believe life is like this: every moment must be filled with passionate conviction, or we smell a phony”

Story prompting: [#Redirect16] Showing students who were caught in a kind of self-defeating cycle regarding grades both statistics and videotaped interviews of upper-class students with the same story (first GPA was low, then became higher) had a lower chance of dropping out of college, and got higher grades the following year.

Strategies: [#EricB268] Often performance improves in leaps as a new strategy is applied, in the meantime performance improves exponentially with more trials. [#ErfWorld] Strategy can also be considered the supergoal and methods to achieve that. In contrast to tactics (which can win fights), strategies are there to win wars. [#EricB368] Experts have other strategies, just like priorities and automation to reduce cognitive load. Experts differ from novices in many aspects! [#EricB377] Expert programmers use more abstract strategies, know the salient points in strategies and are more flexible in switching strategies when the situation requires it (are monitoring strategies?) [#EricB710] All strategies are situational, and should be adapted when they are not optimal for the particular combination of situation and goal. [#https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/nieuws/2017/10/onderzoek-karin-smit-meer-inbreng-in-de-klas-werkt-motiverend-bij-vmbo’ers] Students mainly apply strategies if they care about the result (say learning). Note that the same article says that ‘student directed environments’ (students can influence what to learn and how to learn it) are more motivating for VMBO students than teacher-directed environments.

Strength of character: [#Ster27] Strength or force of character was the third of the personality characteristics Cox found of geniuses. {EW: I assume that means that they persevered despite social pressures}

Stress: [#EW] May hamper creativity. Most great scientists didn't complain of lack of time. Why? In any case, when I feel stressed, better try diminish it. [#Medi173] Stress experience is mostly subjective (jumping out of airplanes is recreation for some). Defined by aroused physiological response, perception of the stressor as aversive (if you could avoid or diminish it, would you?), must not feel in control of the stressor. The unregulated surges of blood pressure when stressed roughen up the inside of blood vessels, which gives an elevated risk of heart attacks and strokes. Also on the long term it hurts the hippocampus. Stress also hurts declarative memory and the executive function {EW: hence people doing things over and over when stressed?} It can also lead to depression. [note that some individuals are strangely stress-tolerant – there are differences! {EW even though there may be another price for that setting}] Is greatest in the workplace when a great deal is expected from you and you have no control over whether you will perform well.[#EW] Stress may inhibit analytical thought and grab the first half-recognized pattern that comes along (reverting to old habits when under stress!). [#EricB443] Stress may cause high-status teammembers to listen better to low-status members, but may also discourage communication between members as people become more focused on their own roles.. [#EW/Goede voornemens] Does stress lead one to seek distraction? [#Zill51] People with higher stress watch more comedy and less news; unless there is a serious problem or the negative state must be kept alive for other reasons. [#NS090711, Sian Beilock] In stressful situations, the ability of working memory to direct attention to what is important is compromised, especially if you add worry to the mix. [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvU44vB8X7E&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=5] Stress shuts down the prefrontal cortex. [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201106/exercise-protects-some-not-all-against-stroke] The stress of low SES seems to negate the health benefits of not-smoking, healthy eating, exercise etc. [#Gawan182] Stress is counteracted by knowing what to do [checklist, knowledge] [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/radical-teaching/201005/want-children-pay-attention-make-their-brains-curious] When stressed, the brain scans the environment for information related to the threat, which deactivates the higher brain centers, attention is no longer under our control, until stress or perception of the threat is reduced. [#EW260112] Stress hypothesis: autistic people usually have more stress, as do people in cities, immigrants, orphans and children of 'cold parents' – can lead to schizophrenia, but perhaps also creativity/repetitive behaviour necessary for focusing effort an an area? [#Int09032012] Stressed people see mostly the advantages of something, and not the disadvantages. Men tend to take more risks when under stress – women fewer. [#McGon136] Stress shifts your brain into a reward-seeking state. Stress also enhances exitability of dopamine neurons (everything seems more rewarding, even chocolate cake if you normally don't like it). Against stress: exercising, praying, reading/listening to music, meditating, creative hobbies, spending time with friends. Work by releasing serotonin, GABA, and oxytocin. [ #http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2012/positieve-prikkels-en-medicijnen-tegen-depressie.html?utm_source=121120-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=positieve-prikkels-en-medicijnen-tegen-depressie&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Positive stimuli (whatever those are) and drugs help people recuperate from stress and prevent depression. [#NS040513] A little stress is healthy for you (prevents cell damage) as long as you are not chronically stressed. [#NS010613] Animals can be chronically stressed too, for example if there are predators in the area. [#Nelissen196] In females: stress produces oxytocin, which leads women to seek out the company of other women, which (including physical contact) increases oxytocin further and also decreases stress. Oxytocin suppresses amygdala, which decreases fear, including social fear. [#NS091113] Stress levels usually plummet when going for a walk (also euphoria from running) – both may help fit children do better at school. [#NS?Stay calm to stay asthma free] Chronic stress seems to predispose to asthma/airway inflammation, so having a neurotic personality can put you at risk (so try to become calmer?). [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2015/hersenen-anders-na-stress.html] After stress, even while the immediate stressor has gone and heart rate has gone down, the connections between the amygdala and memory areas related to emotional processing are still more activated than usual; possibly to form memories and/or to help the brain to calm down. Those same connections seem chronically more active (even without stress) in people with high neuroticism. [#NS2015”A pill to protect against stress?”] Children exposed to stress tend to be better at coping with stress in later life. [#NS240115”Health of nations” early childhood experiences can produce lifelong abnormalities in the stress response – young animals exposed to chaotic, inconsistent parenting have high levels of stress hormones. Abnormal development of prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. The more events a child experience (domestic abuse, etc.) the larger the chance of problems in adult life. [#McGon38] Stress decreases heart-rate variability.Friends and religious practice may help. [NS211115BenefitsSuicides] Eligibility for disability benefits reviews push people into more stress, depression and sometimes even suicide, likely because of the uncertainty in the process. [#NS270216] Stress causes depression, which makes people turn to religion. Religion does not seem to help against depression, though. [#Catmul226] One pixar director tells himself that there is time, even if there is not. Also, using metaphors, seeing problems as familiar pictures (an archeological dig, a topsy-turvy pyramid to be balanced, a maze, a long tunnel, a ship with crew...[#Gall128] Most stress is caused by being attached to something. [#Kluw63] Stress has two phases; and short stress HELPS us learn; long-term stress has permanent negative effects on the hippocampus. {EW: so … people may avoid difficult things since it may give them stress {noradrenalin may counteract the pleasure derived from serotonin}, but a bit of stress is good. Long-term stress may however damage memory and such} [#More76] Performance degrades under stress, so we need as much unconscious competence as possible to reduce the effects of stress. It can also help to diminish stress-thoughts while performing, so we can focus more clearly on the task at hand. [#59sec195] Praying for others helps relieve stress (as does keeping a sense of humor).

Stressors: [#Hooked48] our life is filled with tiny stressors that we are usually unaware of. Typical stressors are boredom (counteracted with excitement), stress (serenity) and loneliness (connection).

Stretching: [#Robi181] The fourth function of a mentor, stimulating the mentee to go out of his or her comfort zone.

Strictness: [#PieWetzer] Many parents are not that strict, especially since they work hard and are stressed, and don't have the energy to do battle with their child.

String-trick: [#Sommers113/EW] Making people conscious of their strings being pulled is often enough for them to yank back, like I managed in the essence-workshop.

Strokes: [#EW/Juggler] Would beautiful women (and strong men) become more extraverted because going out gives them more 'strokes'/rewards? And that that may dampen down their pleasure center and fuel slight addiction to going out?

Structure: [#EW] School may help give children structure if they don't have enough at home. (KIPP, for example). Clear rules and environments prevent nervousness and worry. Is not always a good preparation for the chaos of a workplace though {Andi? Myself?} [#Ster418] Structure in the classroom may aid creativity. [#Laird23] Does insight in a problem depend on understanding the underlying structure?

Structured controversy: [#Clar224] Forming heterogenous teams of four, with two sides preparing one side of an argument. Then let them synthesize them to one position. Works better than traditional debates, individual learning, or groups stressing competition.

Struggle: [#Howe26] Many geniuses had to struggle to make a living. But there were exceptions, such as Darwin.

Stuart-Smalley-method: [#Redirect68] Saying “I'm a loveable person” works if your self-esteem is pretty good, but backfires if you don't believe it, for then you are reminded of all ways in which you are _not_ a lovable person.

Student loans: [#C2W140314] 43% of Americans has a study debt – Fed warns for 'bound generation' that has no money left to invest to help the economy. [EW: also bad: bankrupcy laws make exception for student loans-  you can't get rid of them!]

Student performance: [#Hatt1] Variance in student performance is determined for about 50% by the students themselves, 5-10% by home and schools and peer effects separately, and 30% by the teachers.

Students: [#Hatt32] Engagement (having the same challenging learning goals as the teacher) is critical in class, but is counteracted by many factors. Students can be confused, bored (too easy, too few consequences of learning); most of the material taught is already known to students, and 85% of time spent listening (or pretending to listen) to teacher talking. All students need be engaged! [#Cito2011] Almost all primary school students like school and think in a positive way about their teacher. [#NRC160213] JanDerksen complains that students nowadays can't concentrate without pictures. They can't concentrate while you're reading a book, and would read a book if you told them to. Nowadays they ask which pages they can skip and which questions will be asked. Half of 500 (psychology) firstyears has no idea what they are doing. [#NRC?] Half of students stressed; main causes: fear of future, chance of job, unemployment, money problems, but also social pressures. [#Kuchner98] Student's main concern is “what am I going to do with my life?” - are always looking for something big and exciting to work on.[#ChemWint06] “Be nice to all your students. Have expectations but don't be judgmental. You can't tell who's going to be famous”

Study: [#Howe42] Csikszentmihalyi found that those promising teenagers achieved greatest results who liked study most (or disliked it least), as most teenagers dislike study, as it a solitary and difficult, whereas company and relaxation are so much more pleasurable. The difference is usually that the family background of those who like study is both more stimulating (higher educational expectations, parents provide more opportunities to learn) and more supportive (clear structures and guidelines in the house, family members can depend on another, youngsters knew what was expected of them). Such youngsters enjoyed study more and were more alert. [#Crop37] At the Mint, Newton did what he always did when confronted with a complicated problem: he studied it -bought books on economics, commerce, finance, asked searching questions, and wrote volumes of notes.

Study choice: [#Denktank] Children do not always choose what's best for society (few girls wanting to study technology, for instance), and choosing what's best for them may also be difficult! The (realistic or unrealistic) image of certain professions also plays a role. A wrong study choice also contributes greatly to students leaving education prematurely, or delaying their entry to the job market. [#BegeLeiden] <Marcel Vooijs> Ongeveer 16% uitval in eerste jaar, 8% ommezwaai. Uitwonend zijn en laat voor studie kiezen zijn risicofactoren, ook jongens en niet-westerse allochtonen, persoonlijke omstandigheden, eindexamencijfers, mensen met een beperking. Te weinig sociale binding. Maar zelfs bij een intakegesprek kun je studenten geen verkeerde keuze uit het hoofd praten (al biedt de univ vaak ook geen alternatieve adviezen). Expectations should be clear and credible, positive consequences for performance, negative consequences for non-performance. “niet wat ik ervan verwacht had”, “studie te moeilijk”, “studie te zwaar”, “teveel leuke andere dingen”, “persoonlijke omstandigheden” | docenten: “werken voor een 6; niet gemotiveerd; onvoldoende kennis/voorbereiding; werken teveel naast de studie” / geen controle, onpersoonlijk, zelfstandig studeren. [#VWO-examenresultaten en succes in de propedueses Geschiedenis en Psychologie- ICLON] Beste voorspeller is gemiddelde van schoolcijfers, niet CSE (misschien meer meetpunten)

Study partner: [#Bregman10] Find a good study partner (look at lists of grades). They can at least help with good notes and summaries {EW: and with study strategies?}.

Study period: [#Higbee80] Recommended that study period is shorter for difficult tasks, young / inexperienced learners and early stages of learning.

Study skills: [#Dwec221] In Dweck's experiment, teaching study skills was not effective without teaching the growth mindset too. [#Hatt189] Interventions can be cognitive (note taking, summarizing), metacognitive (planning, monitoring, where, when and how to use tactics) and affective (motivation, self-concept). Study skills help with surface understanding, but need be combined with content for deeper understanding. Forethought is more effective than evaluation is more effective than monitoring. Organizing and transforming (paraphrazing, summarizing) is also great! More passive skills such as time management are less effective. Older students take longer to learn meta-cognitive skills, as they need more time to unlearn their skills.

Study strategy: [#Dwec59] Developing a good study strategy works. {EW: like Zimmerman? Yet having a good study strategy would not necessarily be linked with a growth mindset}

Study tips: [#SimoneKeijsers091014] bedenk hoe je met het bestudeerde iets in de praktijk zou kunnen doen. Of duik internet op en kijk wie zich met het onderwerp bezig houdt en op welke manier. (Kan handig zijn om daar wel een tijdslimiet aan te zetten, internet surfen gaat maar door als je niet uitkijkt).

Studying: [EWL271111] Most people assume that good students are 'born' that way, and do not consider the option that good students also use more effective study strategies, let alone ask and learn from them. [#SurelyYou’reJoking] "Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.” [#https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/nieuws/2017/oktober/samenvoegen-vakken-betere-resultaten-geneeskundestudenten/] Study results improve for medicine students if subjects are integrated (so not loose heart – kidney and such), and if there are examples from practice.

Stutterheim, Duncan: [#Int080711] Very smart (high grades in gymnasium until he discovered music). Advantage was being raised in a village, one culture that was a clear market. Failed VWO. Father was director of CMG and advised him to find a job. Father advised him to see what everyone else sees, but do what nobody else does. Lesson learned: don't be 'off focus', doing things you don't care about 'for the money' (like magazine or restaurant)

Subconsciousness: [#Ster219] Charles Darwin's notebook show early hints of thinking towards evolution, even though Darwin himself did not realize it himself; reading Malthus' work merely catalyzed his conclusion. [#Nass111] People didn't trust the agent because he had been clothed in a Dell T-shirt (even if most people didn't notice that consciously)

Subjects: [#Will48] Of each discipline, it may be most important to teach the core ideas that come up again and again, so that students for a minimum investment of time get a maximal understanding of papers in the discipline. #[NS220815GetLucky] The more subjects Edison worked on simultaneously, the greater his output of patents.

Subotnic: [#EricB291] Researcher who studied the adult lives of high-IQ-children. Most are fairly successful, but true excellence is rare.

Substantive judgment procedure: [#EricB433] In contrast to formal judgement procedures (which use logic and probability theory), substantive judgement judges the likeliness of something on the basis of how easy it is to imagine a narrative of it consistent with the known facts; this is especially a problem for experts, who find it easier to use substantive judgement in their domain because of their great knowledge there. [usually formal judgement is only used as a 'last resort' when the more natural substantive judgment cannot be used]

Subsystems: [#Wolt22] Primary neurons pass on their information to other layers of neurons, which may form an abstracter subsystem (for example, activating the concept of a 'line').

Subtitling: [#LineBarger, Journal of Educational Psychology, juni 2001] Subtitling for 'deaf' people (so not for foreign languages) helps kids concentrate on the main story.

Success: [#Dwec211] There is something called the 'disease of success', thinking that because you are successful it is because you have great qualities, and forgetting (and dumping) the hard work and striving that made you successful, and without which success cannot last. [#Mehr133] Success in different areas of life correlates with four factors: Relaxed temperament, aroused temperament (negatively), disciplined goal orientation, and intelligence. Also physical attractiveness; intelligence is 'hidden' in goal orientation. Success types distinguished by Mehrabian are emotional success (general happiness and satisfaction in life), relationship success (satisfactory, harmonious and productive interpersonal relationships), physical success (health and fitness), work success and career success (though those are not so clearly distinguished) [#C2W_carriere_2013] Dekker made career jumps; relatively easily, since being successful makes it easier to try new things. [#NS280810] Seeing pictures of women described as 'competitive' makes heterosexual women (and gay men!) become less happy with their bodies and want to eat less. (Norman Li) [#Jansen24] Beware of 'success' as you get so many offers you can't do what is really important anymore or do where your true passion lies. At the start, you can use those offers to explore what suits you best, but then cut down. [#Muraka/EW] Would a need for independence and not caring whether others care for you be necessary for success?[#RootAOI] In an Israeli study, success was found mostly correlated with participation as an adolescent in “challenging leisure-time activities” that need significant intellectual and time commitments [music, drawing, computer programming, chess...] {EW: might that just reflect the tendency of those people not to like to atrophy?} [#Bloo529] Simple tasks and short range goals where children can be successful is important in the first phase of learning a field. {and also for adults/Toastmasters?} [#Franzen241] 'Warm glow of success' – succesful people have a greater tendency to help others and to support good causes. [#Hargit55] Success in science can depend on having the right environment (working in the USSR did not help) or making your discovery memorable by giving it a name (like quarks). Or simply because they are latecomers without the network.[#Clar358] You can make people get self-confidence by letting them experience success by constructing tasks of optimal challenge (not too difficult or too hard), match the learning architecture to background (directive for novice, guided discovery for expert), give guidance and feedback (for example charts to show goal achievement over time), incorporate social models of success (“if he can do it, why not me?”), and help learners assess prerequisites to training. (in education) [http://www.educationaldatamining.org/ITS2006EDM/superby.pdf] success in university (= not dropping out) best predicted by grades in high school, hours of maths in high school, not smoking [-: economics/social sciences in high school, having to finance one's own studies, being older than average] +: most regularly attend classes, understand that homework is necessary, not only focus on what interests them. {time spent with family or socially does not seem to matter significantly}. Finally, how high a student estimates his/her chances of success, and whether the course at the start of the year is not judged too difficult, and how well someone feels prepared for academia. If you feel you have chosen well to enroll at your university, and not overestimating the time investment needed for success, works as well. Preferring group work to working alone also seems to help (?!); but in some universities the relative ranking of the variables in influence seems to be really different - first or 163rd! (so university does make a difference). Still, even with LDA (best classification method) only 57% predicted correctly into 1 of 3 classes. [#Newport12] The hardest part of success is forcing yourself through the work, to force the skills to come. You may not want to have big goals at first, just set the goal at being the best you can at whatever you do.

Success depression: [#Pers1] Some people become really depressed after achieving what they always wanted {EW: because no new goals give them less action/less energy, or it is not as great as they have hoped?} We think that achievement will change our lives, while in fact it rarely does. In addition, ultra-focused lives can be barren of family, friends and hobbies, so relatively little to take its place {non-pensioning professors, pappa?} Or is 'the good life' just psychological purgatory (stress seeking release, like IMF-director?)

Success spirals: [#Steel139] Can increase expectancy.

Successful managers: [http://www.vkbanen.nl/banen/artikel/Promotie-Ga-borrelen-met-collegas/1201684.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly&utm_content=20120331] To get promotion as a lawyer, it helps to visit the office drinks. Also, men who regularly drink in the bar tend to earn more money than men who seldom or never drink (?because they're more extraverted? Or less inhibited while drinking?)

Suction 'pulling': [#Weng62] If you describe rapidly, you don't give your editorial mind a chance to edit. {EW: is this good?}

Sudbury schools: [#HandoutGray] Six factors. Social expectation (and reality) that education is children's responsibility. 2. Unlimited freedom to play, explore and pursue own interests. 3. Opportunity to play with the tools of the culture 4. Access to a variety of caring adults, who are helpers, not judges. 5. Free age mixing among children and adolescents. 6. Immersion in a stable, moral, democratic community. Books Geay: Democratic schooling. Greenberg: Legacy of trust / The pursuit of happiness.

Sugar: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200912/sugar-addiction-in-your-body-not-just-your-mind] Just seeing sugary foods may already stimulate your muscles to take up more sugar, making it harder for you to resist temptation. Simple solution: keep it out-of-sight; for example, not offering junk food in school makes students not more likely to buy it outside of school.

Suggestion boxes: [#Deichmann16] Suggestion boxes save companies lots of money, like 136 million euro for 2010 for Deutsche Telekom. GameChanger (Shell) gave about 90 patents in 10 years.

Suicide: [#Davidson101] Child abuse alters the expression of genes in the brain, which makes individuals less able to cope with adversity, which leads to suicide {EW: less clear thinking, so sooner not finding a solution?} [#NS250513] Genetic predisposition for suicide may be independent of depression; suicide victims have striking similarity in gene-expression, and different from depressed brains. 10% of suicides have no history of mental illness. Lithium seems to help against it. [#Flourish142] Majority of suicide among soldiers in Iraq due to failed relationship with spouse or partner. [#NS The S word, 24-1-2015] Talking about suicide at all stages of a mental illness decreases the chance that a patient will kill him/herself. [#NS220815] Suicide risk is greatest in people who are addicted to drugs, incarcerated or a family history of suicide. 90% of people committing suicide are depressed, but only 2% of depressed people commit suicide.

Summarizing: [#Watt64] Summarizing what you read or what the author said may be useful.

Sunk cost effect: [#RoosVonkInt240212] The sunk cost effect is greater if you had more personal responsibility (so not if your predecessor invested the money). Related to consistency?

Superficial: [#EricB50] Novices see and represent problems more on their superficial characteristics, experts on a deeper level, more closely related to meaning/function.

Supergaze: [#NS110812] Staring at each audience member for 2 seconds at a time helps people pay attention.

Superrecognizers: [#NS211115SuperRecognisersPinpointStrangers] Super-recognizers are not all the same – some are good at comparing faces, others are good at remembering faces, and some are markedly better than others (some are 'super', others are 'less super')

Superstition: [#Syed190] Many sporters are very superstitious. Explained by Skinner as pigeons associated random behaviour with the regular dropping of food pellets. Rituals can be good, if it calms down or gives feeling of control (placebo effect), but can be disadvantageous when really interfering with performance.

Support: [#Bloo548] A society cannot support 10,000 professional pianists or research mathematicians: perhaps talent always need be sponsored, compared to regular occupations. [#Tigg116] For all change processes, find someone else who can help you. Do you need a listener, mentor, or “lotgenoot?” [#Geowissen09] In no other country, students feel as little supported by their teachers as in Germany [hence poor German school results?]. Of course, a complicating factor is the argument between the Bundeslander and the political parties.[www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/TEs%207.doc] Setting higher standards and giving more support, having a warmer and more supportive relationship, are beneficial for student's achievement. [#Hatt194] high-achievement students profit much more from extra support than low-achievement students [EW: which happens when classes get smaller. But perhaps the high-achievers ARE the high-achievers because they are more effective in getting knowledge from schools/teachers?]

Suppressing thoughts: [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hhGcusoGYc&feature=autoplay&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&playnext=1] For smokers, trying to not think about smoking worked the first week, but backfired thereafter.”Ironic rebound” Also goes for food, anxieties, worries, “white bear effect”. Trying not to think about sad things actually makes you sadder than thinking of the saddest thing you ever encountered [EW: because more sadder things are possible, or no coping mechanisms in place yet as experience would cause?] [#HayesS26] Note that if you suppress a thought in the presence of an emotion, finally the emotion will make you think the thought, and suppression will make you think the thought and feel the emotion. (also works for behavioural predispositions/muscles)

Suppression: [#Nass155] Suppressing your emotions leads to lower working memory capacity (so worse memory for new information), less satisfying social interactions, and in general in life lower satisfaction and well-being, and a less optimistic attitude (lack of close social relationships and support)

Surface features: [#Clar247] Surface features (what you see, hear, smell, perceive) are often so salient that they hide the deeper principles and hamper any transfer but near transfer. Experts however have deep structures.

Surface understanding: [#Hatt28] Teachers aim/think they teach deep knowledge, in reality students learn 'strategically', and adapt to the exams and tests, which often test 80% or more knowledge of facts and procedures, and require 20% of less thinking.

Surge of energy: [#EW] What creates a surge of energy in me?

Surprise: [#Zill76] Surprise heightens the 'sensory enjoyment' caused by destruction (such as a glass pane breaking).

Surveillance: [#NS070913] If individuals know they are likely under surveillance, they have decreased autonomy. They are less likely to voice opposition to the government or support for unpopular opinions.

Suspense: [#Zill29] Suspense only works if the audience has anticipations of what will happen and preferences for what should happen. Being responsible can add to the suspense, as long as there is uncertainty. Suspense is largest when the 'good' outcome is less likely than the 'bad' outcome, though not impossible. [#Zill167] For female viewers, too much suspense leads to distress, making them 'tune out' and diminishing enjoyment.

Sustainment principle: [#EW/Liv] For talent development, one needs generally to get out (fun, recognition, attention) what one gets in, or at least alternatives need to be even more harrowing. If neither of those alternatives is true, you disband the guild [effort in exceeds reward out] or stop developing your talent.

Swaab, Hanna: has developed TalentenKracht. Contact?

Swan-song phenomenon: [#SimonB177] The phenomenon that a creator finishes a last masterwork in the last year of his or her life. [EW: perhaps due to enhanced motivation and focus, more critical choice of ideas? Of course, exhaustion may also hasten death]

Sweet spot: [#EW/other] When training, the exercises should not be too easy (boring) or too difficult (discouraging)

Swimmers: [#Bloo141] The top swimmers also had parents willing to make great sacrifices, to give their children the opportunity they never had had. Relatively few parents had been in competitive swimming, a majority (>75%) of parents had a definite interest in athletics, though mostly passive as an adult, and considered athletics important for health and morality. Children had chores, were expected to be very disciplined. And strong encouragement and support. First just 'swimming lessons', but some went on to swimming clubs (mainly recreational for the summer) and those who for some reason excelled there were encouraged to invest more and more time and energy. Swimmers seemed more competitive than their siblings. First coaches and clubs mostly chosen for convenience: were close! Being in a team was important to keep going through the rough times, and often there was a personal relationship with the coach (the coaches found it important too, that students would trust them despite coaches chewing them out sometimes) Coaches who only looked at successes and not as persons often overworked their students and lost their trust. Often coaches set (time) goals and intermediate goals, sometimes in negotiation with the students. Families really turned into 'swimming centered families' in the middle years. Swimmers were much more competitive and determined than their siblings. Last phase: find master coach, often someone who already coached champions, treated swimming as a science, and coached students also psychologically. Swimmers became more independent, were discussing with their coaches, giving feedback too. Coaches must be flexible enough to be collaborative. Being in competition with their teammates gave immediate challenges and feedback, and also more self-confidence.

Switching: [#Ster255] The best correlate between tests and creativity is the component (of intelligence?) that allows one to switch easily between different representations/mappings (blue/green ? grue/bleen). [#Kluw230] Switching tasks seems to be aided by (internal?) relevant verbalization (like 'color'). But mosty recent 'irrelevant' tasks are suppressed most strongly. [#Hargit173] Klug knew he didn't want to stay in a particular field for too long, and, while successful in virus research, switched to tRNA. [#Strien54] Would creatives be able to switch? [Pasteur: chickens had not been 'bedorven', they had been vaccinated!]. [EW: would it be possible to practice switching, seeing things in a new way, like humor. Exercises?] Of course, not all switches make sense or are of practical value. Gestalt switch may help creativity. But even monkeys have them (attaching sticks to one another) – still, affected by learning. Is hindered by 'fixedness', that we see objects as only one function, especially when the environment strengthens those cues (the box is filled, for example).

SWOT: [#EW/Brent] Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. But also note that Brent subdivided those in internal and external, benefits and harms. But that may not be the best understanding; you should take SWOT with the system analyis (some system – input – output), an opportunity is only an opportunity if it's there, if you qualify, and if it gets you what you want.

Syed, Matthew: [#Syed1] British table tennis champion at age 24. Causes: parents, for no discernable reason, bought table tennis table in 1978, placed in garage. Older brother was passionate about table tennis too, many hours of matches. Mr Peter Charters was teacher and senior figure in table tennis community, national top coach, with a special table tennis club, the Omega club. At 19, found top player Chen Xinhua (who had moved to Yorkshire) to coach him with a regime that continually tested his outer limits.

Symbols: [#Laird34] For a system of symbols you need primitive symbols, ways to combine the symbols to complex symbols, and a mapping from symbols to the 'real' domain and the other way around. Entities can also be abstract, like numbers. Note that symbols need not represent something real, they can represent something abstract (such as “five”) or something that does not exist in our world (like a griffin). Conversely, the outside world is translated (as good as it can be) into symbols as well.

Symposia: [#Hargit138] The early Cold Spring Harbor symposia could go on for weeks, sometimes only one lecture a day with copious discussions. Furchtgott's doctoral project grew out his experience in Cold Spring Harbor, and one of his interactions in a later symposium (he was invited speaker) landed him a postdoc position.

Synaesthesia: [#EricB541] Synaesthesia is not always associated with superior memory. In fact, the emphasis on surface characteristics over meaning may make learning meaning instead of 'random data' more difficult (some authors suggest this to be similar to Asperger's). [#NS191209] People seem to mostly experience synaesthesia on things they focus on, numbers in their peripheral vision don't assume colours. So synaesthesia may only occur when attention causes higher brain levels to be activated in signal processing. Other strand of evidence is that they learn new colour-grapheme connections way too fast for automatic processing to be involved. [#NS140913] Cultural synaesthesia also exists: in China, the color white is often identified with a harsh, foul odor; in the west with soft, sweet smells. And in the past, mint was perceived in the west as heating and drying. However, some associations (maluma/takete with soft and hard forms) may indeed be universal. [EW: waarschijnlijk kan 'natuurlijke' associatie worden overschreven met oefening/training]. Nice trick is to add weight to remote controls, as customers associate weight with higher quality. [#NS221114MixingSenses:SynaesthesiaTaughtToAdults]. Daily half-hour training sessions to teach 13 letter-colour combinations can make adults somewhat synaesthetic (as long as the training lasts). Also increases IQ by 12 points, possibly due to intensive training with memory-related tasks.

Synchronisation: [#NS090213] Apparently brains of two people can be synchronized, and does oxytocin have anything to do with it? Would it help with ideas? [#NS290111] In close proximity, people tend to mimic each other in all kinds of ways, especially non-verbal ones. Seems to also result in synchronized brain activity.

Synchronizing: [#NS240514] Friendship may be helped by being with each other, and doing things together (rowing as a synchronized pair) releases endorphins.

Synthesizing: [#Root03] Last of the thirteen thinking tools, it is combining all different tools into new ways of knowing. Feeling and knowing become the same, looks a bit like synesthesia.

Szent-Gyorgyi, Albert: [#Hargit207] Was almost all the time at his experimental desk. Would call his co-workers over often to show them his experiments and he would walk over to their benches to see their experiments. He always wanted to see every detail of the experiment and examine all the results. He taught his co-workers to train their eyes, to use appropriate instrumentation, to notice even the minutest differences. Stressed the value of observing changes, minute as they may be, and the value of the unexpected.

Szilard, Leo: [#Hargit223] Was a bit threatening as he was always two steps ahead of everyone else; but also dispersed his energies and was not great at follow-through. Was excellent as someone who talked to people and getting and disseminating news.

Taboo: [#Sidis] If a child is inquisitive, let it scrutinize anything, do not block its thirst for knowledge with taboos.

Tacit knowledge: [#EricB216] Tacit knowledge seems to not exist; most experts can verbalize their reasoning after some thinking {EW: though people are quite good at making reasons up if they don't know something. And some pattern-recognition problems in learning would probably also fall under that... Reread tortoise-mind?} [#EricB615] The main distinguishing characteristic may be that it is not explicitly taught, so it may be a hallmark of practical intelligence. Seems (in academia) to be higher in students with low socioeconomic status (perhaps they needed more discipline to survive? Or are more ambitious?). Tacit knowledge can be made explicit by people (mentors, communities of practice, ?psychotherapy? [#Wagn1236] Tacit knowledge is knowledge about managing oneself (against procrastination), tasks (how to start writing a paper), and others (motivating others). There seems to be a general factor in tacit knowledge; people who can manage themselves can generally also manage others quite well, as well as having proper long-term and short-term goals. {EW: would this be related to 'emotional intelligence?'} The skill of acquiring tacit knowledge may be learnable... [#Clar78] Experts often are not conscious of certain parts of their performance, debuggers report only 53% of their actual actions. Apparently those parts are 'forgotten', and one needs other knowledge-elicitation tasks than interviews to discover them.

Tactile simulation programs: [#Hatt154] Tactile stimulation programs help infants at risk of developmental delay have better outcomes, works both for social outcomes (0.61) and cognitive/language (d=0.36)

Talent: [#Howe122/EW] Never praise children for outstanding talent, that is one of the things John Stuart Mill's father probably did right. His father emphasized that any advantage he had was just a matter of having another education, not some special 'talent'. [#EricB481] In sports, performance is at least partially determined by e.g. gender in specific types of contests, such as the sprint, so not only practice can account for the differences. [#Csik23] Talent is a social construction, a name for a property evaluated positively in ones culture. [#Kijk[10]2010] Black sprinters may be faster than whites because their centre of gravity is on average three centimetres higher than for whites, which would make for 1.5% speed increase. White people would have 1.5% faster speed when swimming, though (Adrian Bejan). [#C2W250113] Ronald Brus: “People confuse talent with the ability to do things even when you're not yet sure about what the result will be, and er 'andere dingen voor te laten.' [#RobertZatorreScience] You can predict how fast people will learn a task of learning to discriminate extreme fine differences in tone by measuring the current level of how the auditive cortex discriminates tones. [#https://www.msu.edu/~ema/HambrickEtAl.pdf ]  Deliberate practice seems to account for only around 35% in expert performance in music and chess, and some people reach master chess levels much sooner than others so (one even with only 832 hours of practice!) Intelligence plays a role, though exceptional working memory may be even more important. {EW: two questions though: first, not all deliberate practice is made equal; second: over half of variation is unexplained. Implying that that is all genes instead of environment seems a bit premature...} And of course, the psychologists are quite mad at Ericcson for being popular. Anyway, starting younger may indeed be better, more brain plasticity?

Talent contests: [#Tonn68] Not bad; the chance of being 'discovered' is very low, but you learn to overcome stage fright, and discover how it is to have an audience {EW: and perhaps have an extra impetus for practice}

Talent whisperers: [#Coyl162] The best coaches are not particularly leader-like; they DO have vast experience in teaching and enormous sensitivity to the needs and current weaknesses of the student, and adapt their teaching likewise. Need the Matrix, perceptiveness (do everything to figure the student out, listen and watch really well, listen to responses), the GPS-reflex (give short, quick, urgent orders, like “now do this”, and short confirmations “there it is”, and “Good, okay. Now do it...”) and finally theatrical honesty, being able to have all moods and personalities that work, as long as you remain caring and honest on the inside. They make the connection (JaMarcus)

Talentenkracht: [#Tale] Dutch research programme aiming to discover the talents of children {EW: so they believe in talent. A dangerous assumption. I don't need that hypothesis. They could also just mention talent for 'marketing' purposes towards an ignorant world} Founded by logican Johan van Benthem, Robbert Dijkgraaf and mathematician Jan de Lange.

Tao, Terence: [#Robi104] Loved mathematics since he was two years old, winning Fields medal at age 30. Thinks that the ability and freedom to play with maths – to think of games, give yourself small challenges, is most fun. Was never content until he really understood something. Could discuss the games with good teachers. Says that the ability to focus (and some stubbornness) is important. {wikipedia: father pediatrician, mother mathematicics/physics graduate. Brother (with double doctorate) features in book on autistic savants}

Target arousal: [#EW270713] Walking through nature may work for ADHD since the body sets the target arousal to lower (like mother after massage?)

Task analysis: [#EricB189] Task analysis may stop at the level that the probability of failure times the price of failure is low enough.

Task negative network: [#NS160814It'sAllTooMuch] In contrast to the task positive network, the task negative network (loose thoughts/daydreaming) is the default state of the mind; in it, you are not controlling what you are paying attention to. Either the task positive network or the task negative network is active. Though central executive mode (task positive network) may also be activated when we perceive something salient or rewarding.

Task switching: [#Kluw239] Task switching may occur by the prefrontal cortex activating all plausible codes in parallel, and those codes 'fighting it out' by lateral inhibition until one code emerges victorious.

Taste: [#EW] Good scientists have a taste on which problems are both important as reasonably solvable. {know a lot + diverse knowledge} [#NS221212] Taste is influenced by other senses; red is associated with sweet, and putting strawberry mousse on a white plate makes it seem sweeter than on a black plate. Drinks are more thirst-quenching from a blue than from a yellow glass, angular pictures and plates make food seem sharper or more bitter. A heavier bowl makes yogurt seem more intense, denser and expensive. Sea sounds when tasting oysters makes them taste more intense and 'seafoody'. Also music: staccato bursts are for saly; Sweetness has circular shapes and high notes, slow, soft and consonant music. Bitterness low notes and smooth flowing music. Sourness dissonant and fast music, high notes. [#NS040513] About 25% of people have a variation in their PTC gene that impairs their ability to taste bitter food, they are 'bitter blind' (bad luck if you wanted to become a professional taster). There are also people with very many tastebuds, but those may not become supertasters as broccoli and chili taste too strongly. Note that taste can also be trained by exposing taste buds to more flavours, and smelling different products such as herbs, and putting names to them, even for a few minutes a day, can help improve sense of taste.

Tate, John: [#http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/20100614/interview-john-tate-getaltheoreticus/] Father was professor of physics; as a boy, liked math, but didn't pursue it seriously. Academic career was however 'logical', given his father. Was hit in the gut by the beauty of symmetry and number theory [book by E.T. Bell], but thought you had to be a genius to do maths, so avoided studying it. Discovered his passion for maths since he could get free study books, and gathered 20 maths books versus 1 physics book. Had very inspiring mentor, Emil Artin, who was a famous mathematician and also good educator (had written standard book on algebra). Also collaborated extremely much with others; letters, but conversations were best, usually got ideas from that. He had the idea that the other must have gotten the same idea as himself, but funnily enough, that wasn't so. Had trouble publishing [perfectionism? Not interested in writing, but in maths?]

Tate-effect: [#http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/20100614/interview-john-tate-getaltheoreticus/] John Tate read the book “Men of Mathematics” by E.T. Bell. Was fascinated by the work, but simultaneously had the idea that he was not brilliant enough to give a meaningful contribution; and went to study physics instead, where you could still get beautiful result if you weren't a genius [father as role model].

Teacher evaluation: [https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3459] teachers who know they'll be evaluated are thereby discouraged from challenging existing beliefs. Also, there is little relationship between SETs and learning -sometimes even negative!

Teacher training: [#Hatt112] Demonstrations have the greatest impact on knowledge and attitudes, theory the greatest impact on skills, information (?feedback?) is in between; all three need to be included in teacher training. Note though that often beginning teachers are taught skills they already mastered. Note that conceptions often also need be changed; not seeing teaching as something interpersonal like parenting, but setting academic goals. Observation of actual classroom methods, microteaching, video/audio feedback, and practice are best for training; discussion, lectures, guided field trips and coaching and modeling worked rather poorly. Interestingly, training benefited from having high school and elementary school teachers train together rather than apart. External experts help better than school initiatives. Compulsory of voluntarily did not matter, and it was particularly important that erroneous beliefs were challenged (especially that some groups of students could not learn as well as others)

Teacher-responsible learning: [https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3459] Unfortunately objectives are seldom made explicit in university, tasks are often of little interest to students, feedback focuses on content (facts) rather than skills, and application is seldom addressed. Motivation is based on extrinsic rewards and punishments in a competitive environment (Kohn 1986). The underlying message at universities is that learners are not responsible for their learning. This message from the education industry starts long before the university. Using a sample of 506 males (median age 10.5 years), half were randomly assigned to a five-year program that included tutoring in 2 academic subjects and counseling, while the other half (the control group) received no services. In a 30-year follow-up, those from the treatment group were highly positive about the value of the program. But compared to the control group, they were more likely to have committed a crime, been alcoholic, died younger, been in occupations with lower prestige, and report that their work was not satisfying (McCord 1977). Might the teacher-centered approach foster a sense of helplessness about learning?

Teachers: [#McK] Best school systems select the best to become teachers, making the entry highly selective, and paying good (but not great) starting compensation. This also drives up the status of the profession, so it attracts even better candidates. Teacher's level of literacy (vocabulary and such) seems to correlate well with performance. Note that teacher effectiveness increases dramatically during the first five years of teaching. Politics have great influence on status of teachers, cultural context does not seem very relevant. Good teachers have a high overall level of numeracy and literacy, strong interpersonal and communication skills, a willingness to learn, and a motivation to teach. Best model is selecting people before they start teaching training instead of letting them being filtered out by schools. If there are many more training places than teacher positions, teacher training becomes less attractive to the better students. Starting salaries should be in-line with other graduate salaries, or people will not enter into teaching. Above this offset, there is no great effect on extra applications. After getting into teaching, raising salary is however not very important; most motivated people stay despite low raises {EW: frog in heating water-effect}. Status is also related to the perceived amount of education teachers are required to undertake. Finland also has lots of special education teachers to remedy the gap with the weakest students (though most students, even the best are sometimes sent to the SE teacher, mainly to prevent it having low status). [#Watt46] Teachers can also point you towards the best books among many. Having different specialized teachers for different subjects is commendable, as one person can hardly be expected to know the full breadth of human learning. [#Colv67] There's a reason the best golfers still go to teachers, for their knowledge and their ability to see what you cannot see. [#Coyl173] First teacher is often professionally average, but students stay up to 6 years with him/her. Distinguishing characteristic is that they are great at creating and sustaining motivation. Lots of positive reinforcement, seldom critical, but DO set standards and expect children to make progress. [#Witt42] Too many parents choose the teachers who are cheapest, most suave, or from the 'right' background, rather than the best educators. [#Bloo411] First teachers gave lots of rewards (like stars and Hershey bars) {EW: as addicting as WoW?} Inspiring teachers inspired much harder work and much faster progress. Ambitious energy can be unfocused until someone latches on to a teacher who inspires them, who believes in them, who makes them feel special. When they didn't love or respect the teachers, when the teachers were not dedicated to the students or music making, they felt they were going nowhere. [#Bloo] Best high school teachers are enthusiastic about their subject, knowledgeable, give children room/independence and do not give answers if the children can figure those out for themselves. [#Robi18] Ms Hoover inspired Matt Groening, possibly through saving all his drawings. [#Csik182] Teachers need to show strong support and encouragement, but also passion for their subject. Influential teachers are interesting people (they do not work for pay, nor are bored in the weekends), model interest in teaching and a professional life. Also make problems interesting, and at least in reach for the individual's skills. They know when to intervene and when to hold back, and when to use a mistake for further improvement. Third: high support, know when students are troubled, care for students, but also see potential and encourage them to reach it. Teachers were often involved in their domain in some form outside classes. Best science teachers knew their subject well, were clear in the presentation, and provided helpful feedback on practice exercises well in advance of formal exams. Arts students liked demanding teachers most who helped them identify their strengths and construct a programme for growth. No omnipotence or star quality demanded from teachers, enjoyment and importance of the talent areas however, yes. [#Hatt5] Expert teachers can identify essential representations of their subject, can guide learning through classroom interactions, can monitor learning and provide feedback, can attend to affective attributes, and can influence student outcomes. Deeper representations of teaching (so less fragmented, can see commonalities); try to solve performance problems of individual students by seeking more data, spend more time trying to understand the problem. Are more flexible, can handle emergencies or unexpected problems (what to do if a class understands things too quickly or too slowly) Challenge, deep representation, monitoring and feedback are best at separating expert from experienced teachers. {EW: Hattie notes also that teachers are extremely wary of nominating the 'best', in contrast to most other professions} It's what the teacher gets the students to do, rather than what the teacher does, which is most important; students must be actively involved in their learning, with a focus on multiple paths to problem solving. Then go beyond the solution towards interpretation and analysis, to greatly value the subject and strive for the very best standards. It is also important that teachers talk about teaching with their colleagues, and that they ask/get feedback on their teaching from students. Three critical feedback questions: “Where are they going?” “How are they going?”, “Where to next?” (for both student and teacher). [#Hatt73] The effect of teachers is smaller in elementary school and reading, stronger link with community and everyday life, and larger in secondary school and 'weird' subjects. Best teachers build relationship with students, teach students new ways to study the material, are willing to explain material and help students with their work; teachers who make a difference turn on their students to the love and challenge of their subject. Teacher effects largest in low-SES-schools (more variability between teachers, or less buffer from home environment?) Teacher education seems to matter relatively little (d=0.15), certainly compared to a few years of experience (d=0.39). Subject matter knowledge matters relatively little (d=0.12), presumably only up till a certain minimum, with very much diminishing returns thereafter. Number of education courses help [or just show that teacher is dedicated to improving?], as well as number of years taught. Possibly also teacher's general academic ability, especially verbal ability. Student rating is well correlated to teaching outcomes, but students seldom give useful feedback for teachers to improve (or teachers don't use it effectively, d=0.38). Challenging students and high expectations are appreciated most, followed by monitoring and evaluating, and help the students construct their knowledge of the subject). Interestingly, the best teachers don't always produce striking growth on achievement, but they do increase deep understanding over surface understanding a lot (from 29% to 74%), which is often not measured by state examinations. After 25 years of experience teachers are about d=0.12 more effective, more than half of that effect however occurring after the first few years. Ineffective teachers can however be quite devastating, having deleterious effects years down the pipeline. Teacher-student relationship is important, empathy, warmth, non-directivity (students initiating and regulating many of their activities) [#Bregman2] Asking teachers how to prepare best for an exam “tips” can be extremely valuable, most of them are eager to help. [#EricsD436] Teachers are also 'trained' by their students to improve {EW: at least in theory, look at high school teachers} [#EricsD440] Most teachers don't adapt their teaching because they don't see their students fail in practice (such as in medical diagnosis); those who do see that failure, tend to be more eager to investigate the causes. [#Will65] Teachers are judged {EW: and effective} on two qualities: whether the students like them and they are organized; they need to connect with students and arrange the material so that it is interesting and easy to understand. [#Redirect219] Good teachers can also be tough if students don't live up to their potential.[#C2W-101112] There are few career opportunities for teachers – school leadership positions are rare, and there are usually no other ways to grow. Teachers also have very little influence on the direction the school is going (or leadership decides that some students _must_ go to a class even though they are not suitable for it, teachers don't have a say). [#Geowissen09] Uwe Schaarschmidt has investigated over 16000 teachers, by 60% there was lots of exhaustion, 'overspanning' and 'resignation'. Often teachers think they can teach because they have been taught, or because they don't dare to do a more difficult study. Most of the teachers getting a burnout later already felt overtaxed during teaching college. 50% said that they didn't become teacher because of a 'pedagogical ideal', but because the study seemed 'uberschaubar' and the work 'secure and family-friendly', or because it was near their parental home. [#Flourish57] Would students indeed learn best when they fall in love with their teacher? [#http://www.oratiereeks.nl/upload/pdf/PDF-4662weboratie_Oostdam_-_DEF.pdf] Having confidence in their students, encouraging and stimulating them is important for teachers. [#http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2014/genomineerde-anita-van-dissel.html?utm_source=150113-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=genomineerde-anita-van-dissel&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] profile of a very good teacher: gives authentic lessons (invites navy officer to teach students that reality is often not the same as is written), asks students what they want to achieve, and helps them with her contacts to internships and jobs, also has clear expectations of students herself. Also asks many questions of her students. [#http://thetalentcode.com/2014/08/27/24-rules-for-becoming-an-adult-prodigy/] Find a teacher you like, and who maybe scares you a little (that is often a good sign).

Teaching: [#EWL/McK] Teaching is a way of speeding up the learning of learners, let them master new material faster, and with fewer mistakes. Good teachers speed up learning more than bad teachers – the worst teachers can even hinder learning. The difference between good teachers and bad teachers on student performance is about 50 percentile points in three years (and students progressing about thrice as fast)! Students that do not get good teachers early in their education seldom recover the lost years. A successful school system both selects the right persons to become teachers, and continues to invest in teacher training. Second-most-important factor is good school leadership. [#Watt67] The recipient of teaching should always recollect and review the lecture, and also read other authors and discuss with his tutor. [#Robi240] The best teachers do not teach subjects, they teach students. [#http://www.vkbanen.nl/onderwijs/742904/Hoe-maak-je-de-btavakken-leuk.html?utm_source=redactionelenieuwsbrief&utm_medium=nieuwsbrief&utm_campaign=20090507] Teaching others also seems to motivate students and increase their understanding. [#Clar100] It's better to first teach key components/concepts, and only then the actions, or how they work together. Segment lessons in 5 minutes (e-learning) and 60-90 minutes (instructor-led learning). [#Hatt1] teachers should teach each class as if it was the first time they taught the class [EW: presumably to combat the danger that the teacher forgets that the student does not know the material yet, as well as producing automation and not being responsive to differences in cohorts] [#Mare181001] Poor structure (lots of detours) and bad preparation don't help. [#Mare270901] Don't overestimate how much students have understood from the material they have had to read, and asking questions is good, though beware if students stay talking with each other. [#VU201002] Ask students what they think themselves of something is a good way to get their attention. [#Hatt148] Teaching (analysis with feedback) is more effective than witnessing a model, or than studying an analysis system and self-analysis. [#EricsD] Being an expert in an area does not guarantee that one is good at teaching that expertise to others. [#Medawxv] Medawar considered imparting factual information a relatively unimportant part of teaching, the core was focusing thought and reading and to encourage reflection. [#Will165] Change aids attention, so when teaching don't use the same method for 1 hour nonstop. [#NRC060513] Change can be implemented; one school does it by hiring trainers to train the six internal 'subject matter specialists' (rekenen, language, motoric skills). Those specialists educate the rest of the teachers (EW: more acceptable to teachers because they know the experts?). External trainers and specialists look at the lessons teachers give, and give feedback. Teachers have to work hard: follow trainings, discuss those, formulate goals and writing plans. [#NS270713] Teaching a subject can kindle your interest into researching it (Kevin Lafferty-parasites), though you need enough knowledge in the wider field (Lafferty knew a lot about marine biology already)

Teaching experience: [#Howe5/EW] Both Mozart's and Agassi's father (and Polgar sr. as well as Pa Jackson) usually taught their later children better, having improved their teaching from experience with their first.

Teaching load: [#Hargit106] Some young scientists were encouraged to publish papers by promising less teaching load for every paper publised.

Teaching software: [#Medi68] Teaching software (for reading) in combination with a teacher works better than either alone.

Team building: [#Nass83] Teambuilding works best with identification and interdependence.

Team leaders: [#Isaacson150-162] Inspiring yet nurturing, competitive yet collaborative, nonhierarchical esprit de corps. Need to be able to motivate people to share your vision, and when to push ahead against doubters and when to heed them.

Team membership: [#Nass110] Being member of another 'team' may make people prejudiced about you, labeling you with the perceived properties of your team ('impulsiveness').

Teams: [#Nass98] People who feel part of a team act more cooperatively, feel happier, feel a stronger sense of beloning, control, self-esteem and meaningful existence; make more correct decisions, make decisions more rapidly. Also helps newbies learn because members behave more similar to each other than in a normal group. [#Googles zoektocht naar het perfecte team/DuhiggSlimmerSnellerBeter] beste teams: iedereen kan zijn zegje doen, mensen zijn sensitief voor elkaar’s emoties.

Teamwork: [#Dwec104] People who want to be a superstar can do poorly in team sports. [#Gawan103] Two threats to teams are firebreathing, dominant superstars, or disengagement “that's not my problem”. However, both are problematic, for when unexpected complex problems arise, people must talk together to determine how to solve it. Introducing yourself, knowing another's names, helps. Giving your name and mentioning a concern in the beginning helps even more [even in WoW?], an 'activation phenomenon'.

Tears: [NS270216]seeing tears on sad faces boosts feelings of sympathy, supportiveness and friendship towards the individual pictured. Tears also help us overcome feelings of revulsion (like seeing an injured face). Is also hard to fake, making it an 'honest' signal. Neurotics and people who are highly empathic cry the mosts, but people like narcissists, psychopaths and toddlers use tears manipulatively.

Technasium: [#Denktank] A Dutch highschool where students work during longer periods on a real and relevant project (www.technasium.nl).

Technical lock: [#Greene231] What happens if you lose a sense of the overall purpose of your work, of the larger question at hand, or what impels you to do your work in the first place.

Technique goals: [#Clar365] Stimulate people to strive for technique goals instead of outcome goals.

Technique mastery: [# http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/06/12/what-you-know-matters-more-than-what-you-do/ ] One great young researcher deeply mastered several new techniques a year, and then hunted for new applications. [#EW: inverse of what I'd expect]

Technology: [#EricB413] Technology may be somewhat counterproductive if it discourages people from seeking their own data. [#Strien230] Never forget that an invention can radically change how people live, and what society looks like! 'We shape our buildings, afterwards they shape us.'

Technology enthusiast: [#RobertoCortez] Don't let them rearchitect, clarify how things should be done (we don't want to use these and these technologies, and it should last for 10-15 years), research facts for the problems, need to be included in decision making.

TED talks: [#EW] May suffer from the pundit/hedgehog syndrome – striking, simple messages, that are basically wrong.

Tedium: [#NS191209] Many NS writers and editors were turned off on scientific research by the tedium of experiments [EW: so why do scientists work then?]

Teeuwen, Hans: [#Dusa99] Teeuwen is not attempting to be some kind of national conscience, he is always looking for theatrical tension. Lots of fear of failure, didn't audition for conservatory (apparently mother found it important!) But did not find find his way in life (even acting academy was too traditional, wound up in drug use before he, with an uncle as mentor, dared try another acting school, where he was successful. From his youth he was fascinated with everything funny, from Laurel and Hardy to Toon Hermans, from Freek de Jonge to Monty Python. Is perfectionistic- practices until it is perfect. Can also be monomanic (watching all episodes of The Office) {EW: talents seem neurotic, while 'success' seems to correlate with a stable, pleasing personality} Thinks that the discovery, enjoyment, wonder, urge to understand comes first, and excellence follows. Passion precedes professionalism. Lots of repetition, but is NOT perfectionistic about his house or his hair! Always nervous before a performance, always fear of loss of face. Perfect preparation is ideal, however, since he can then let himself go, get into the flow and monitor the reactions more carefully; even though such performances are rare. Is now imitating/learning from the mastery of phrasing of Frank Sinatra.

Television: [#Zill28] Watching television seems to appeal partially because it it less difficult/challenging than reading; does not make mental demands. [#Hatt67] Up to 10 hours TV per week is not too negative, above it it is negative to achievement, especially for females and people with high IQs, and for people who are older (1 hour/day for age 7, 0 hours for age 17). Effect mediated by reading skills which can be slightly increased by TV [but why?]. [#LineBarger] Looking to educational television while a toddler correlates to reading more in high school.

Teller, Edward: [#Hargit229] Had extraordinary number of ideas, both in his field and other fields, and shared them freely.

Template: [#EricB527] A higher-order structure, containing several chunks (meaningfully?) linked. Example: a chess position may consist of several chunks of multiple pieces.

Temporal encoding: [#Kluw12] Apparently learning also includes learning the time between CS and US. {would be logical since people can also learn timed skills}

Temptation: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201107/top-five-guilt-inducing-foods-and-what-do-about-it] Thinking how bad you'll feel after indulging makes you more likely to sin – it's better to think of how proud you'll be after resisting temptation [or perhaps why you have that goal] [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200907/the-limits-self-control] Would resisting temptation make you more likely to resume a bad habit, but then because of extra stress or because of willpower depletion? (or both?)

Ten-minute-rule: [#Medi74] Generally we can automatically hold attention to a subject for about 10 minutes, after that, it needs to be dragged to the subject again. Teaching method: cover one core idea (that you can describe in 1 minute) in each 10-minute segment, spend the other 9 minutes elaborating and discussing. General idea first {EW: unless too abstract? Sounds like activation of previous knowledge – where to store} Lecture plan at beginning of class, liberal sprinklings of 'where we are' throughout.

Ten-year-rule: [#Colv62] Ten years is generally necessary to reach an international level in most fields, note that people can continue to improve even decades after that! [#Ster231] In some domains one can reach mastery faster – in painting it seems to be about 6 years, in poetry five (but usually ten). [#SimonB88] In general, the less time a genius takes in apoprenticeship, less than 10 years, the more eminent does he/she seem to become!

Tenacity: [#Root] Tenacity/persistence/perseverance is not necessarily a virtue for scientist: the most successful scientists limit the amount of time devoted to recalcitrant projects before turning to something more promising.

Tennis players: [#Bloo213] Parents generally middle-class to upper middle class. In 80% one of the parents (usually the father) was a very enthousiastic and competitive tennis player. Very close-knit families, spent lots of time together (also/especially around tennis fields!) Families held values of working hard and doing well as very important Doing less than one's best was simply not acceptable. First coaches were universally very encouraging/supportive people (like the piano teachers) Some had incentives (candy, dimes). Often, the kids hated to lose, some wanted to please their fathers. Determination/willingness to work hard was perhaps more important than physical characteristics, as was extreme competitiveness: they hated to lose. Often changed to better coach in middle years. First phase: fun and motivation, then: structure and precision. {competitiveness fueled the emotional drive needed to succeed?} Often went to college, but chose colleges for their tennis programmes. College tennis was more about strategy and endurance. Also often started weight training. Players themselves chose and changed coaches dependent on their needs of the moment. Family's role in later stage was limited to moral support.

Terror management: [#McGoni140] News of death bolsters our hang for status products [EW: and science for Fermi and such?]

Terrorism: [#NS130914] People become terrorist because of influence of peers, a personal grievance, such as a crisis of identity, that opens them up to a new political or religious ideology, a sense that their cultural in-group is being persecuted, moral outrage at injustice, and access to a poltically active network. [#NS190817Anatomy of terror: What makes normal people become extremists?] It are not the chronically poor or deprived, but people experiencing uncertainty in their lives - recent converts, young people who have just left the family home, those with psychiatric problems. Note that killing a charismatic leader may inspire a potent posthumous charismatic appeal, or cause splintering that results in otherwise suppressed extreme factions rising in prominence.  Jihadists fuse their individual identity with that of the group, and they adhere to 'sacred values', which are so strong that they can even overcome group identity [EW: no sacred values in China?]

Terstall, Eddy: [#Busa76] Started as camera-person. Didn't go to movie academy, wanted to study life (politicology). Studied a lot of movies, and books about directing. Doesn't have the power to concentrate long on something, aimed to get himself thrown out of boring classes at highschool. Thinks that uncertainty whether one really gets the best out of himself is important.

Test: [#Coyl18] Study once, test thrice works better than studying four times. {EW: how to implement that? May be better because of active recall} [#Schm211] Tests are more potent learning tools than 'presentations'. [#Hatt179] Frequent testing helps, perhaps because it makes goals more clear, but mainly helps if it is accompanied by feedback (d=0.62) Frequent testing seems more useful in elementary school than in highschool (d=0.03) [EW: less free time in high school?]

Test anxiety: [#Higbee66] Test anxiety may not necessarily be due to anxiety, but due to lack of 'test-taking skills' (save difficult questions for later, for example).

Testing effect: [#Wiki] Testing works better than regular learning/exposure to the entire material. Students writing their own version/full description of the lecture/book chapter from memory have much better recall. [#Higbee73] Next to making questions, you can also look at the subtitles of a book and words in italics and try to explain to yourself what they mean. [#Wyner47] Would the testing effect also work because you add a bit stress, activating the amygdala a bit more than with the 'normal' word?

Testing the water: [#Newport9] Steve Jobs & Wozniak made circuit boards for a bit of extra cash at first, not leaving their day jobs. Generally it seems best to develop skills/test the market while you don't yet depend on it for a living.

Testosterone: [#NS010510] Testosterone makes people more cooperative when playing economic games. [#Int180211] Testosterone diminishes empathy though, especially in people with high testosterone exposure in the womb. [#Int230911] Testosterone diminishes in married men who get children, especially if the children have just been born or who spend lots of time caring for their child. Men with a high testosterone level also seem to marry earlier. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2013/eveline-crone-in-debat-over-mannen-en-vrouwenhersenen.html?utm_source=130312-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=eveline-crone-in-debat-over-mannen-en-vrouwenhersenen&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief ] Testosterone is linked to risk-taking behaviour; can stimulate the reward areas of the brain, especially the striatum [#Nelissen235] Note that at least testosterone decreases after losing a fight or such – testosterone only increases after a challenging fight, the fight must not have been too easy. May also cause generic striving for achievement. Testosterone also decreases after marriage and fatherhood. [EW: scientists achieving less] The combination of testoserone and adrenalin determines the amount of sexual arousal. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614001524] Prenatal testosterone exposure causes lower mentalizing and higher giftedness (or at least gifted boys tend to have higher prenatal testosterone exposure and lower mentalizing abilities). [#JiskaPeper] Having relatively a lot of testosterone makes boys more reckless [en 'sensatiezuchtig', but makes girls more self-aware and diminishes their jealousy and suppressed anger. [#NS050714BiggerThanButch] Testosterone actually prompts us to act in ways that boost our social status – which can be cooperating as well as bragging.Testosterone may make you less trusting, but also more willing to 'give back'

Tests: [#Robi228] An emphasis on testing may decrease the joy of students and teachers alike, as well as whittle the skills a student learns down to those things that are tested. May be more suitable for diagnosis than selection. [#EricsD437] You should always ask whether the tests test what is relevant for real-world performance, that you don't test for calculating ability while students need to have quantitative insight. [#Flourish130] Intelligence and reaction speed and etc. tests correlate to pilot's performance, though they are better at detecting the 'turkeys' than in distinguishing the good performers from the top.

Tetlock: [#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_E._Tetlock] Scientist who found that 'experts' predicted little better than chance on world events, and certainly worse than statistical computer programs. People predict more often that things will change for the worse than is logical (best prediction is that things stay the same). Experts even worse than laypersons on own terrain: were more certain that their predictions were right (nuanced experts did better, but were rarely on talkshows)

Textbook method: [# http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/10/you-know-what-you-write-the-textbook-method-for-ultra-learning/ ] Describing what you learn in your own words helps learning [similar to writing/journalling?]

Textbook writers: [#Ster248] Textbook writers are knowledgeable, but seldom produce innovation. Is the knowledge not deep enough? Don't they have enough knowledge? Or are they bad at finding problems or unmotivated to ask critical questions?

Thalamus: [#NS190512] Gastric bypass surgery shrinks the thalamus (memory, attention, concentration and sensory information) in some cases due to the thalamus having ghrelin and GLP1 receptors, which hormones are diminished/changed by Roux-en-Y-surgery.

The Future Project: [#SellHuman37] Connects secondary school students with adults who can coach them. Check it out!

The Right Stuff: [#Gawan161] The myth of the hero who solves insurmountable problems through intelligence, creativity and courage (and leadership and/or athletic feats?)[EW: ideal male?]. Relying on checklists or teamwork destroys that mythos, even if it is beneficial for the profession or (in medicine) the patients. [EW: would females feel the same way compelled to display 'the right stuff' themselves, or focus more on seductiveness or friendships?] [#Aviation Mental Health: Psychological Implications for Air Transportation] Right stuff: instrumentally focused (goal-focused), and socially competent, able to incite teamwork. Wrong stuff: also instrumentally focused, but higher in hostility (in long term, crews will adapt, though). No stuff: not motivated/focused.

Themes: [#Robi232] Using themes like the French revolution, and letting children participate in plays and building guillotines, school became much more fun.

Theorist-practitioner divide: [#Seligm62] Practitioners can be as wary/dismissive of theorists as theorists can be uninterested (or grant-fundamentally constrained) to solve problems instead of puzzles.

Theory: [#Laird57] A good theory is like a computer program: it should predict what comes out, and preferably with as few assumptions/instructions as possible for an as wide as possible range of phenomena.

Theory of Mind: [#Medi69] Would better theory of mind make better teachers or leaders? {theoretical knowledge or 'social skill'?} [#NS080613] Clasically, children show that they know that Sally looks for her phone where she left it around age 4, but interestingly already at 15 months they stare longer if they see Sally looking at the right place at once {EW: speech vs subconscious?} We may both have an explicit and an implicit system, people with autism seem to lack the implicit system, but can think about other's positions if they have time to think. Skills may be improved by experiencing social scenarios [EW: like Mystery had after extensive exposure to women?] Shakespeare may be interesting since he stretched the theory of mind (Iago wants Othello to think that...) Size of prefrontal cortex tucked behind eye sockets seems to correlate with number of friends/social skills.

Thermodynamical stability: [#Kluw260] Long-term memories (at least in computer and DNA) need to be thermodynamically stable, else keeping them intact will require too much energy!

Thinking 10x: [#Schmid217] Instead of ‘you are not thinking big enough’. If you want to have 10x as much of something, conventional, incremental improvements won’t get you there.

Thinking around it: [#Higbee56] To find data in memory, loop over all things associated with that fact first (remembering a schoolmate's name? Think of the volleyball team, the graduation ceremony, etc.)

Thinking languages: [#Adams86] Verbal, pictorial, mathematical, the 5 senses. Visual=perceptual imagery (what one sees about the world), mental imagery, and graphic imagery (what one draws). Mental imagery: clarty and control (perhaps enhanced by painting, mom?) [interesting: are you better at visualizing people or objects? What would Krekels say?]. Smells and sounds and such may also be of some use, in problems that involve sound and smell, or simly to enhance the visual image.

Thinking styles: [#Weiner110] In Zuckerman's research, factual knowledge was not the most important thing Nobel Laureates claimed to have learned from their mentors – thinking style was.

Thinking time: [#EW/Zangrando] May be subdivided in three parts: generating/refining new ideas, evaluating ideas, and executing ideas. Top scientists do more of 1 or 2 relatively to 3.

Third place: [#Imagine151] Next to first place (home), second place (office), third places like cafes are places where likeminded people can meet and bring together a diversity of talent, ingesting coffee or alcohol. {EW: like Olympia Academe}

Thomson, JJ: [#Jaffe204] Chose a field of study where little was known yet (cathode rays). Worked for years with diverse experiments on the problem, was probably familiar with the work and theories of Faraday. Was very strong (though not 'best') mathematician as well. Had almost every afternoon tea with his students, discussing science and more, asking them for their opinions on his ideas as well. Loved those meetings (was at his best at those). Challenged those like Wilson to photograph one electron. Took over 8 years to complete, though. Millikan was the first to weigh an electron, though, after thoroughly reading all work of Thomson and his students, also used radium to ionize an oil droplet and measure its falling speed between charged copper plates. Though still cost three years of patient labor. JJ was human, helpful, and very inspiring, and had a great intellect. [#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson] Note that 8 of his research assistants later won Nobel prizes, and his son did as well (so more than Sommerfeld?).

Thomson, William: [#Crop78] Thomson was many things: physicist, engineer, teacher, inventor, political activist, but before else was a problem solver. Loved debate and competition too (like having a 'race' with Helmholtz about waves). Father was professor at mathematics, Thomson himself published 12 papers while still an undergraduate! Huge capacity for hard work, and carried proofs and research notebooks with him always and wrote in them when the spirit moved him (which was apparently often, sometimes to the amazement or annoyance of his guests). Founded first British physical laboratory, though greatest achievements were behind him at age 31. Later became director of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Lost in his work, but loved his family.After graduating in Cambridge, went to Paris for six months to meet French mathematicians and experimentalists.Was also inspired (got new ideas) from the wrong but interesting work of his Edinburgh colleague Rankine. Also befriended Joule. Further influenced by the theories of Fourier and Carnot. Did glimpse new theories (such as entropy), but did not have the discipline (or dare take the risk) of exploring it to its limits; possibly also because he had a habitual lack of contact with the rest of the scientific community. Problem solver, but not good in seeing the big picture. (Though he probably saw some of it, he was bad at concentrating on one problem for long). Still had the feeling of failure (though loved science, and the contacts with his fellow human beings). Was an enthousiastic lecturer, but one that went high over the heads of his students with his newest discoveries and speculations. A kind of wonder that people could be so kind, and a wish that he could have done more to deserve it all {EW: so had very high standards for himself?}. Unpretentious human being.

Thoroughness: [#Hargit71] Herbert Brown's co-worker found that only one in 57 compounds behaved inconsistently; could have been due to impurities. Brown insisted on a replication, which led to his Nobel prize. Seeing the unexpected is little use if you ignore it.

Thought suppression: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201107/why-trying-not-be-prejudiced-backfires] Trying not to be prejudiced causes more actual prejudice than being reminded of the good facets of tolerance (good for own mood and well-being, calling it a personal choice), similar to 'white bear effect'. Being mindfully aware of which thoughts enter your head, and not try to push them away. [#McGon211] Trying to suppress a thought by day makes it more likely that you'll dream about it [EW: would that help increase motivation about a problem, a sort of anti-Pauling?]

Thoughts: [#Davidson161] Not only our experiences, also our thoughts shape our brain / brain plasticity.

Threat: [#Nelissen177] Threat impairs regular memory, but strengthens emotional memory.

Threat effect: [#Volkskrant] The effect that hearing that men or another category of people do the task better stimulates the emotional centres and inhibits ability; women tend to suffer more from such effects than men.

Three good things: [#Flourish84] Write down three good things that happened to you today? Also: why did this good thing happen? What does this mean to you? How can you have more of this good thing in the future?

Three I's: [#PoorEcon16] Three I's prevent effective action: ideology, ignorance and inertia.

Three-worlds-model: [#Hatt26] Surface learning (facts, procedures), deep learning (relationships, rules, generalisations) can lead to a third world of learning, the worldview, the correct/better understanding of the world, which is constructed out of the 'lower levels'.

Thrill: [#Csik182] General school does not have the 'thrill'/passion of singing; teachers (and students) don't perceive something like singing {EW: or maths/chemistry?} as very important.

Thync: [#NS160416CanYouThyncYourWayToACalmingVibe?] electrodes connected to the neck can stimulate nerves that release stress or relaxation hormones.

TIE: [#EricB159] Typical intellectual engagement [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3852/is_199901/ai_n8827980/] The definition of TIE centers around intelligence as a typical performance parameter with high scores relating to (1) an expressed desire to engage and understand the world, (2) an interest in a wide variety of things, (3) a preference for a complete understanding of a complex problem and (4) a general need to know. Is thought to consist of three parts: problem directed thinking (understanding things deeply), abstract thinking (enjoying solving problems), and reading. Problem directed thinking seems correlated to conscientousness(C).

Time: [#Watt169] Using time to study something can overcome a somewhat lacking memory or not being able to think lightning-fast upon a subject. [#IntTheories] Time is an essential component of every good motivational theory. [#Will125] It can take years to master a skill fully, a teacher can often only work with the material he/she has to increase the level, the final goal may only be reached by a later teacher or self-study. [#Strien238/Bacon] 'Discoveries are a birth of time, rather than a birth of wit.'

Time analysis: [#Newport73] Mike Jackson notes down what he does with his time in 15 minute intervals.

Time management: [#Root] Needs to be excellent for scientific success. [#Howe49] Darwin spent enough time in Cambridge to pass his non-scientific subjects, but really focused on his passion. [#Csik86] Talented students tended to spend more time in classes, less on jobs, socializing and chores, more on hobbies and TV{!} Talented teenagers socialize in general with smaller groups (parents or siblings or friends), non-talented teenagers socialize with entire family, even often with family and friends at the same time. Talented: more time per week alone. [#Jansen22] “Stones”: put bigger stones (most important tasks] first in your basket, then fill the rest with sand (the less important stuff). A bit similar to my 15 min an hour writing. Use shortcuts for unimportant tasks (like copy-paste) or simply don't do them. Or get creative in saving time (telecon instead of face conference?). Exercise: list what you did the last day, and decide which deserved 'no's'.

Time management strategies: [#Int030812] Juggling (but stressful, and tired), phases (but requires maintaining network and skills, and saving money), delegating (have lots of helpful family and friends, not being too perfectionistic), combining (very good agenda usage, multipurposing can be hard), techflex (less travel time, but being available 24/7), simplify (needs willpower and environmental support, needs to redefine success. Monotony (EW?))

Time schedule: [#Parr148] Having a schedule that says what one will do every hour of the coming week may help diminish the self-discipline needed for one's work. Works by restricting choice?

Time series analysis: [#Kluw271] Learning is comparable to the computing process of multivariate, non-stationary time series analysis.

Tip-of-the tongue effect: [#EW/#Ster418] May be the tip-of-the-tongue effect, which is caused by interference by a stronger but irrelevant stimulus, which must decline before one can find the true answer, is related to creators working very hard on a problem, but only reaching the solution after they have put it aside for a while.

Tiredness: [#NS160612] We tend to find our most creative solutions when we are most tired (early birds late at night, night owls in the morning] [#EW270713] Three responses to tiredness: resist (but danger of damage or bad performance), yield (but danger of not solving a simple problem) or investigate.

Tit-for-tat: [#HaidtH50] Tit for tat (as in vampire bats) only works in groups up till a few hundred. If groups grow larger, things need to be extended with emotions like gratitude and revenge, which amplify and enforce tit-for-tat.

TMS: [#NS18022012] Using pulsed magnetic field stimulation can activate unwanted neurons in the brain (who generally have more NMDA glutamate receptors) and thereby prune them.

Tolerance: [#Weiner172] Edinburgh had “in your face tolerance” - heated debates that were never personal.

Tomonaga, Sin-Itiro: [#Crop391] Japanese physicist, son of philosophy professor. Was not well-coordinated and often sick as a child, so stayed at home and did experiments. Friends with Hideki Yukawaka, who would become famous for his meson theories, and was fortunate to attract the attention of Yoshia Nishina, who had studied in all major European institutes of physics (Cambridge, Göttingen, Copenhagen, Hamburg). Tomonaga worked for two years with Heisenberg, though became depressed as his attempts bore no fruit there. Back in Japan preceded Schwinger's work, but published in Japanese, so went unnoticed until he translated it in English and approached Oppenheimer.

Toolboxes: [#Strien165/Lammertsma?] Small paradigms can be like standard tools, like mice in mazes, or CBT: one framework that seems to have proved its value, and is used by other people. [EW: molepi research; GWAS]

Tools: [#Root] Successful scientists use more mental tools than their less-distinguished colleagues. The 13 tools are observing, imaging, abstracting, pattern recognizing, pattern forming, analogizing, bodily kinesthetic thinking, empathizing, dimensional thinking {EW could I make a game out of this?} modeling, playing, transforming, synthesizing.[#EW] Some tools are easily and widely adopted (chain saws instead of axes), others are not (pair programming, SCRUM). Scientists of course used lots of 'mental tools'. But the more complex it is to learn, the more time and 'brain cycles' it costs (and the less apparent/fast the benefits are) and the less relevant it is (efficient programming if all software consultants lie anyway)

Tools of the mind: [#Bron160] Pre-schooler program which required toddlers to make plans and stick to them “is that in your plan?”, and teaches to stop writing when the music stops (so stop persevering)

Toonder, Marten: [#WimHazeu] Marten Toonder cared more about his artistic career than about his children; and took credit where it was due to his collaborators. And he didn't wait for inspiration: worked very hard according to a fixed schedule, had notebooks for puns like waardering – waarde-ring.

Torturers: [#NS150717InsideTheMindOfTorturers] Many torturers grew up in a violent familym or experienced humiliation early in life. Identity is often broken down when they are recruited, for example they may be forced to kill members of their family.

Toxicity: [#EricB465] Unfortunately, expertise (at least in music) often comes at a cost of hearing loss, RSI or neuromuscular problems, most pronounced for those musicians whose instruments demand most training (such as pianists).

Toyota way/Toyota production system: [#Hooked54]

Trace conditioning: [#Kluw11] Onset US is a time (like a few seconds) after the end of CS. Is less effective than delay conditioning.

Tracking: [#Hatt90] Putting children in different classes based on 'ability' almost never helps students, and low-track classes can be especially non-educational, deadening environments [VMBO?]. Also non-performance discrimination for minorities and children of pushy parents.

Tracking progress: [#Colv193] Tracking progress of a student is a motivational tool.

Tragedy: [#Howe159] The Brontë sisters started to write after their eldest sisters died {EW: and Fermi started physics in earnest after the death of his beloved brother}

Tragedy of the commons: [#NS270811] Can be avoided {and sci coll?} by group and purpose being clearly defined, costs and benefits equally shared, decision-making by consensus, misconduct should be monitored, sanctions start out mild and escalate only if needed, conflict resolution should be fast and fair, the group must have authority to manage its affairs, and the relationship of the group with others must be appropriately structured.

Trait: [#Nett20] Traits are things like extraversion etc. You can never observe a trait directly, you must deduce it from behaviour {though it can sometimes be seen in brain scans}

Trait complexes: [#EricB159] A theory that groups traits in 4 main complexes: [enterprising/social/extroversion/social potency/well-being] [ perceptual speed/conventional/control/conscientousness/traditionalism] [math reasoning/visual perception/realistic/investigative] [Gc.investigative/absorption/artistic/TIE/openness] {EW: could be like mountain ranges: close ones are most correlated, and we all have them all, but some higher, some lower}

Trait pleasure-displeasure: [#Mehr135] How easily someone gets into positive affective states versus how easily he/she gets into negative affective states. Is positive is someone tends to experience positive feelings more easily.

Traits for scientists: [#Feist36] People with certain tresholds of intelligence, openness, confidence, introversion and independence may have a higher chance to be attracted to science.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tCDS): [#NS131110] tCDS seems to help learning and possibly improve math skills long term. [#NS160313] Note that if you try learn two tasks at the same time, transcranial electrical stimulation may aid learning of one task at the expense of learning the other task. [#NS310115] Does not seem to have physical or learning effects at all

Transfer: [#Clar41] There exists near transfer (routine tasks, McDonalds) and far transfer (flexible, making a sale). For near transfer, directive training is more appropriate, for far transfer, guided discovery. For learners with high background knowledge, exploratory or receptive is best. [#Clar238] Often one needs a culture of transfer, in which the working environment allows, obliges and rewards application of the new skills soon after training. Use identical elements and mental-model building, those two will give best transfer to a job, as well as flexibility in application. Though the aimed near-transfer or far-transfer may require you to shift more towards either identical-elements or mental model building. [#Ster245] The double helix model was based on positive transfer from Pauling's helix model, and the negative transfer from Watson's like-like pairing from grad school was eventually overcome (by collaboration?). [#Syed31] Roger Federer could hardly hit the ball in 'real tennis' (an ancient variant of tennis). His expertise was therefore very specific and not very transferable. [#Will120] Practicing on lots of similar problems helps deep understanding and transfer. Also, you may recognize deep structure the first time, but you may not bring it easily to mind when you see a similar problem; practice helps make those deep structures more accessible to your conscious.

Transfer-of-training: [#EricB161] Transfer-of-training is more effective (EW: efficient?) than novel learning.[#EricB461] You can improve transfer by practicing in realistic situations or different situations than your standard practice environment.

Transformational versus transactional leadership: [#Deichmann19] Transformational leadership, defined as leaders engaging employees by engaging their value system, is contrasted to transactional leadership, which uses punishments and rewards to achieve the organization's goals. But it is not clear which form is more effective to generate ideas; there are conflicting study results. {EW: whether someone aims at transformational vs transactional leadership does not mean that he or she is good or effective at it, much will also depend on the rest of management and current company culture/instruments in place. Motivation without method is ineffective; method without motivation becomes bureaucracy and goal displacement}

Transforming: [#Root03] Twelfth of 13 thinking tools. Use of multiple tools at the same time or serially so they act upon another. An example would be the invention of the stroboscope, which used multiple techniques, including visualing, modeling and playing.

Transition: [#Denktank] One of the main problems of education is that transition between institutions (for example VMBO to MBO) can be rather harsh, which makes students drop out. The 'sink or swim'-effect. {like Peter's principle: other skills are required? Rules change, habits don't change as easily} [#Hargit114] George Olah spent 8 years at Dow before he could return to academia.

Transition points: [#Ster175] Wise counsel on transition points is especially important, as missteps there can lead to distortion or even abortion of the road to excellence.

Transsexualism: [#EW] The weird thing is that few, if any people, consider themselves born of the wrong race or social class, and that many people would like their body to be different from how it is. Perhaps it is because people with some tendencies get 'punished' for not fitting in society's mold? Or that it is in essence a matter of belonging, that there are too many barriers to being with/sharing fun with people of the opposite gender?

Traumas: [#Redirect13] Time indeed heals most emotional traumas, though it is hindered if we are reminded of the event quickly and frequently after it happened {EW: playing computer games may not be that bad a way to deal with it then}. Writing therapy is mostly useful if normal processing seems insufficient after a few days/weeks. [#HaidtH139] People who have been through bereavement or trauma seem to be inoculated against later stress (recover faster from it), possibly because they have learned they can handle it. It also helps strengthen relationships, as people get greater appreciation for and tolerance of others. It also changes priorities and philosophies towards the present and towards other people (often: live more in the present, pursue one’s goals, and people are more important than work). Note that killing others can also traumatize people. [#HaidtH147] People who talk about their traumas with friends or with a support group are largely spared the health-damaging effects of trauma. Alternative: 4 days write for 15 minutes [keep writing!] about the trauma.

Travel: [#C2W-280810] Sam Stupp travels a lot, his group can do a lot, but not everything. Discussions with colleagues in and outside the USA give lots of useful information and knowledge. Hopes to inspire people but also meets many young inspiring scientists. Also gives time; at home he is easily swallowed by management tasks, when traveling he feels free to think about scientific problems. Writes his most complicated papers in airplanes and in hotel rooms. [#Sommers23] Only by traveling abroad do you start to notice the unwritten rules guiding social interactions back at home.

Treats: [#NS081016BeesSeemToHaveAnUpbeatOutlookOnLife] Bumblebees given a treat (like sugar water) are more willing to explore a situation of which they are not sure whether it is rewarding – this seems to be due to dopamine, not energy levels [EW: would unexpected treats work best?]

Treshold: [#Eyse192] Simonton postulates a treshold of awareness, a treshold of behaviour, treshold of cognition (consciousness) and treshold of habituation (habit) {EW: would there really be a separate treshold of behaviour, seeing that if something is in awareness, it must perform some actions?} [#Ster261] Below IQ 120, intelligence and creativity seem correlated, above it, not. [#VUMagazine] Henriette Prast: if Americans can only pay for candy with cash, people buy more healthy options. Calories on back of menu card can be counterproductive as most dieters overestimate number of calories in a meal, the pleasant surprise makes them eat more.

Treshold of unexpectedness: [#EW/Wolt62] Things that do not fit in the schema of a situation are remembered poorly, unless they were VERY strange or unexpected. {how does this work? No hooks?}

Triad theory: [#Franzen186] The theory that behaviour will occur only if the three conditions of motivation, capacity (can you do it) and opportunity are at least reasonably present.

Trial-and-error-learning: [#Grin109] Third learning method, first of three association learning methods. Takes place if certain sequence of actions (trying to open a box) is rewarded. Big name: Thorndike.

Tribe: [#Robi108] Sometimes you feel connected to a particular group of people, a feeling of belonging, such as Meg Ryan had with actors. Members of a clan have a common passion, even though they do not always collaborate. They share their passion, but also ideas and techniques. They can support each other, giving the others confidence to continue {EW: similar to smaller-scale collaboration} Part of the inspiration can also come from far-off or dead members of the tribe, like old writings in physics. Tribes may stimulate you to get the maximum out of your potential.

Trigger: [#Hooked41] External triggers are loaded with information, which tells the user what to do next. Of course, much information is known/embedded due to 'training '(hyperlinks are for clicking). More choice/complexity is bad in an external trigger – the less thinking someone has to do, the better. External triggers van be paid (advertisements), earned (awards, good reviews – need to keep company in the limelight), relationship triggers [though beware of 'dark patterns', companies pretending that freinds sent an invite], owned triggers – part of dailt envitonment of user.

Triple-P: [#Trouw-2-711] Pedagogical programme <Touria Belkhyatte: misschien samenwerking voor onderwijs Amsterdam?>. Do not get angry, give compliments for things he does well. Don't forbid (like girlfriends) – that only stokes the fire of adolescents {reactance?} Also zooms in on your own behaviour: what did your child do? (in first, second minute), what did you do as a parent?

Trust: [#Hatt240] Trust within a school is important for academic achievement (d=0.65), as it creates a climate for the teachers where they can freely discuss what works, why it works, and for whom it doesn't work. [#Does Social Capital Have an Economic Payoff? A Cross-Country Investigation* Stephen Knack and Philip Keefer ] Membership of formal social groups does not correlate to economic growth. 'We find trust and civic norms are stronger in nations with higher and more equal incomes, with institutions that restrain predatory actions of chief executives, and with better-educated and ethnically homogeneous populations.' [#Nass179] Familiarity breeds liking, and liking breeds trust. Even if familiarity is minimal (exchanging answers on 12 silly questions), people are much more persuaded by people they 'know' that way. Another way is reciprocity: if you have helped me, I can trust you. [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2013/aminozuur-zorgt-voor-meer-vertrouwen.html] Trust can be enhanced by eating food that contains more tryptophane. [#NS281017Who can you trust? How tech is reshaping what we believe] Generally, we are more likely to trust a stranger if we have something in common, like age, gender or background. Otherwise, external trust ratings  also work; people with high external trust ratings get more diverse people to trust them. When others trust you, you get a bump in oxytocin. (and having more oxytocin also makes you more trusting)

Truth: [#Nass169] People accept almost everything they hear as true, since it takes lots of effort and thinking power to prove something false. So if people are distracted or confused, they are more likely to accept something as true. Also people don't like uncertainty; accepting someone's label makes it much easier to accept or reject that person's statements. People will generally look to confirm rather than disprove. [#EW] There may be a ‘social truth’, which is accepted in a certain social context, culture or situation. There is a ‘real truth’, kind of a scientific consensus, which is amenable to change. There is an actionable truth, which is a simplified model of a situation that can guide action.There may also be ‘moral truths’ - what is good, and what isn’t, which can also guide action.

TSR: [#EricB590] tertiary storage/retrieval (or how well one retrieves information from long-term memory)

Turing: [Isaacson41] Turing was slow to learn indistinct  line between initiative and disobedience. Was slovenly in dress, preferred long-distance running, lost important friend at age of about 15, wantyed to be worthy for him.

Tutoring: [#Bloo4] The average student after tutoring exceeds 98% of the students under normal instruction. [#Hatt82] Note that tutoring next to school seems to be of very limited effectiveness [d=0.09], though one-on-one-tutoring is not that bad.

TV-guide: [#Root03] Trying to duplicate the one-liners in the TV-guide could be a great practice for abstraction.

Tweede fase: [#EW] Dutch programme for highschools that aims to improve student's education by not trying to give them as much knowledge as traditional schooling, but by stimulating them to investigate subjects on their own. The main problems of the programma are: 1) to be creative, one needs lots of knowledge about a subject, so a pure focus on 'finding out things' will not ensure quality education. 2) due to redundancies in for example literature, a very good school book can be much more useful and time-effective than reading through a dozen books in the library, and 3) the government really hasn't diminished the quantity of things to be learned, making it necessary for schools to either switch back to the classical force-feeding of knowledge as that is more time-efficient and/or stressing out parents doing the extra work (projects) for their offspring. 4) the brains of (most?) adolescents are not very well suited to organizing and tackling large independent projects. The basic problem remains that you can't press a pint into a container that could hold a quart: the government needs to choose either for more knowledge and less independence, or less knowledge or more independence. Also, the independence of students needs to be assessed and raised on an individual level, on the sweet spot/zone between boredom and panic.

Tweeting: [#NS020313] Keys to success on twitter is to tweet positive messages, write clearly, and retweet interesting tidbits of news.

Tyndall: [#Crop56] Tyndall loved controversy and hated injustice.

Typewriter: [#Erard79] Winifred Sackville Stoner got a typewriter at age 9 to compose stories on {EW: may help writing?}

Tyrants: [#SimonB127] Tyrants suffer from psychopathology in 91% of cases, in most cases paranoia (55%) followed by alcoholism (41%). Visionaries are the only category that suffers from even more paranoia. In both cases this paranoia may be justified, as their climb to the top was seldom sweet and harmless, and in contrast to other rulers they are not protected by traditions – tyrants after all break any rules that don't suit them, and visionaries abandon existing laws and traditions in order to achieve Utopia.

Tyrosine: [#http://nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/nieuws-2014/sneller-stoppen-dankzij-tyrosine.html?utm_source=140211-extern&utm_medium=e-mail&utm_content=sneller-stoppen-dankzij-tyrosine&utm_campaign=nieuwsbrief] Tyrosine can improve reaction speed. Possibly useful food supplement for cognitive enhancement? [#Food for creativity: tyrosine promotes deep thinkingLorenza S. Colzato, Annelies M. de Haan, Bernhard Hommel ] Seems to enhance convergent thinking (solving puzzles, like hair/time/stretch ? long), but not divergent thinking. Kind of like cognitive endurance/top-down control?

U-curve: [#Burkeman163] Big failures may have personalities quite similar to those of big successes, like charisma and persistence when faced with setbacks.

Unbelievable: [#Nass168] “It is unbelievable but true” can make you sound more like an expert.

Uncertainty: [#Sidis] Perhaps being sensitive to uncertainty (and/or having a nervous temperament) gives rise to a love for knowledge. {EW: perhaps this is why Sidis recommends varying the environment. And may it be a helpful factor for immigrant kids?} {people don't see the familiar anymore; unfamiliar things produce thoughts – why it is so? Next, of course, to having two languages may give access to two sets of associations; talk about problems in Dutch or English?}[#EW/Ster433] Uncertainty/lack of support may increase the discount factor of someone, making perseverance in hard/difficult tasks less likely.[#SteelArt] Would emotional uncertainty lead to avoidance, but cognitive uncertainty to persistence? [#NRC211210] Being uncertain whether a (handsome) man fancies them or not makes young women think about him more, which leads them believe that they are interested in him, which leads to feelings of being in love (though knowing that the other fancies them also helps quite a bit). [#EW] Uncertainty (or ambiguity) seems to amplify stress and fear.

Unconditional love: [#Robi143] Arianna Huffington's mother was always there for her, whether she succeeded or failed, never loving her less when failing. Taught her that failure was part of life.

Unconscious mind: [#SciAmMindNov11] People recognize a slowly revealed picture sooner if it is incongruous to our expectations, like a basketballplayer dunking a watermelon.

Unconventionality: [#Jaffe14] Some old masters (such as Paracelsus) were thoroughly unconventional, and liked attacking established wisdom. Social pressure tends not to be very effective (Paracelsus again){EW: why are so many people conventional then? - perhaps because unconventionality is punished by parents, school and society} Priestley was a 'dissenter' and supported the American and French revolutions, even while that was 'not done' in England.

Underlying knowledge: [#Clar75] Experts often fail to explain underlying knowledge that is second nature to them.

Understandability: [#Siegfried261111] People tend to pay more attention to things that seem more understandable or 'natural' to them {EW: Feynman didn't. But that was perhaps why he was great}

Understanding: [#Busa161] Many masters and future masters have a 'rage to understand' – why something is funny, or correct, or true, or wrong. {EW: compare to the homo logicus and the homo sapiens from the inmates?} [#GladT?] Childen (and adults?) learn something better when they understand it {linking to existing knowledge? - like humor?} [#Nati145] For understanding foreign texts, vocabulary seems most important, then subject matter knowledge, then knowledge of the syntactic structure. Discussing a task in L1 first increases performance on a L2 test relative to discussion in L2 {EW: clearer concept?}. [#Will92] Understanding can be more surface-like or deeper, and more or less transferable. The background knowledge that is awakened by a problem almost always concerns its surface structure. Also, a problem has only one surface structure, but can have several different possible deep structures. When told explicitly that there is an analogy, people can often solve tumor-fortress problem easily. [#Nass67/http://cjonline.com/stories/062501/pro_impressions.shtml] People like people they can understand, either because of shared personality or because the other person is expressive (no pokerface)

Understanding people: [#Greene138] To understand people, pay less attention to words than to tone of voice and body language. Resist the temptation to interpret what they say or do as somehow implicitly involving you, as that will turn your thoughts inward. After you have known people for a while, try to imagine that you are experiencing the world from their point of view, placing yourself in your circumstances and feeling what you feel. Look for shared emotional experiences. Extreme behaviour is often a mask for the inverse emotion. However, people are always in state of flux, so let not your ideas about them harden into a set impression. Seven deadly realities: envy, conformism, rigidity, self-obsessiveness, laziness, flightiness, passive aggression [EW?].

Underwhelm: [#More47] The opposite of overwhelm. If you find yourself bored, try increase speed/perfection/complexity, as you are not using your time efficiently.

Unemployment: [#NS080613] Unemployed people are more likely to be stressed or depressed, to divorce, commit crime, or die early (or is correlation vs causation?). Many unemployed have physical or mental complaints, many of which lessen a lot once they find work! Focusing on health first to get unemployed to work seems too hard (conflicting other time requirements) [#NRC060114] Germany has little educational renewal, but has a very low youth unemployment nevertheless [EW: related?]

Unexpectedness: [#EW] Would unexpectedness (predicted result – actual result) make people curious? [#vdVorst: yes, 'disturbing' expectatations works very well).

Unexpertizing: [#Rudolf/EW] According to Rudolf, if practice diminishes, skills can become un-automated again {EW: perhaps because the links weaken and are not enough anymore to proceed without conscious interference?}.

Unfair offers: [#HaidtH51] If activity in the frontal insula (anger, disgust) is greater than the activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (reasoning and calculation), people will reject an unfair split.

Unhappiness: [#EW/FrankNoom] Three possible causes for unhappiness: 1) having too many negative stimuli. 2) not using all your core talents 3) getting used to a good situation, not intensifying it to let it remain novel and exciting. [#EW] Given that unhappy people feel more driven by the fear of social repercussions, would that mean that they simply are neurotic, or that they really are social outcasts and try to remedy that? But would then striving for status not be similar, a longing for love and warmth? Of course, people are never satisfied and take people for granted – not displeasing people is more important than pleasing people. But social bonds may help against unhappiness, I suppose, though some people have stronger needs than others (dependent personalities). Fight unhappiness with fun and friends?

Uninhibition: [#NRC301010] You can make people less inhibited by first letting them describe a situation in which uninhibited; what was the situation, how did they feel, how did they behave? Also makes people more willing to help others. Reinforcing social norms makes people MORE inhibited.

United States: [#NRC031112] In the United States, assistant professors have their own labs; people get lots of responsibility from the get-go. Americans are also very open to new ideas. The quality of students, however, tends to be lower.

Universality: [#Seth115] Planck liked black-body radiation because it was universal, constant for all substances [and therefore perhaps particularly conductive to findin universal, high-impact laws?]

Unknown: Not knowing something can cause lack of love, but also fear! [#Myst196] Letting a girl get to see your house before a date will reduce her fear to come back with you later. If you have taste in decoration, can also be an implicit brag. Hustle her out so she doesn't have time to satiate her curiosity. [#HTSWW18] People tend to make things they do not understand more complicated than they really are. {EW: or think that they are very complicated, if they can't do it yet}

Unlearning: [http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3543664/2013/11/13/Aantal-laaggeletterden-onder-45-plussers-groeit-snel.dhtml] People who do not read or write a lot (for example, they don't have a job or their job does not require it) lose the ability to write or understand all but the simplest texts.

Unusualness: [#Eyse96] children whose pictures were more original/unusual (or motion, colour again) had more creative achievement.

Updating: [#Susski22/EW] Do professionals really cultivate and update their knowledge?

Uppism: [#EW/IntelliMagic] People have the natural tendency to seek out those who are more important than them (or at least as important). Danger is that you lose touch with the 'floor', or at least don't balance them enough (Gunning-Schepers)

UR: [#Kluw16] Unconditioned response, the natural response to a certain environmental stimulus (say the US), such as salivating when presented with food.

Urban Living: [#SciAmMindNovDec11] Social stress causes higher activation in amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in city dwellers than in students from rural backgrounds.

US: [#Kluw7] Unconditioned Stimulus, or the second stimulus that is presented in learning trials (compare CS)

Usability: [#Hooked68] Remove as many steps from usage as possible.

Users narratives: [#Hooked54] should read like a play.

Utility: [#Paul] actions that enhance cooperation are also useful, even if they don’t have a direct physical effect in themselves.

Utility of effort: [#EricB158] The individual's desired level of effort expenditures in a work context.

Vacation: [#Glad256] Kids from low-income families slipped much more in skills during summer vacations.

Vagus nerve: [#NS130713] Vagus nerve goes to heart, lungs and digestive tract; counteracts the 'fight or flight' response, stimulates the 'feed and breed'-response. [EW: that's why dating includes dinner?] Basal strength of this is known as 'vagal tone'. Low vagal tone seems to be a risk factor for cardiac disease, worse at suppressing inflammation, and worse at regulating blood glucose levels. Higher vagal tone: better working memory and better ability to focus one's attention. More emotionally stable, less stressed, and happier than average. Low vagal tone risk factor for depression, stimulating vagus nerve sometimes used to treat depression. High tone also linked to sociability. Reporting all positive emotions every day for nine weeks and rate degree to which they felt socially connected also leads to increased vagal tone. Loving kindness meditation also increases vagal tone. Exercise also increases vagal tone, hearing positive feedback about yourself or possibly anything that enhances self-esteem, and reflecting on positive experiences. [#NS150111TurnDownTinnitusWithBrainAlteration]The vagus nerve (stimulating it) affects brain plasticity. Helped against tinnitus (played tone in non-tinnitus frequencies, tinnitus may be that neurons of too many frequencies respond to a certain sound, so reorganizing neurons can help) [#Vagus Nerve Stimulation Succeeds in Long-Term Stroke Recovery Trial] Stimulating the vagus nerve increases neural plasticity (if only for a few seconds afterwards) [#HaidtH197] Implied in gratitude, elevation and appreciation. Works with oxytocin.

Valence-Instrumentality-Expectancy theory: [#http://faculty.washington.edu/janegf/goalsetting.html] A theory devised by Vroon, claiming that the effort someone would put in to achieving something is a multiplication of the expected satisfaction of it (valence), the belief that performance will lead to the rewards (instrumentality), and that one's efforts would produce the necessary performance (expectancy)

Validity: [#EricB149] In psychometrics: whether a test measures what it is supposed to measure. (does someone with a strong handshake really have a decisive character?) Criterion-related validity is how well a test makes predictions.

Valproate: [#NS110114] Valproate can inhibit HDAC and restore some brain plasticity, giving volunteers at least some chance at learning perfect pitch. See amblyopia? Anyway, may reopen rewiring for critical periods, treatment for diseases like autism which mistime critical periods?

Value: [#Bloo504] Most students felt their activity valuable, since they were appreciated to the people who mattered most to them (parents, relatives). [#Ster266] High-IQ (but not so creative students) value the same qualities in themselves that they think lead to success in the real world -high creativity students do not. The latter valued a getting along with others and emotional stability most {EW: because they lacked it?} [#Ster332] Placing high value on financial and social rewards may discourage innovation. Prizing theoretical value (understanding) and aesthetic value (beauty) may be more useful for a creator. [#Renwick174] Task value correlates to persistence on difficult or boring tasks, as well as planning an monitoring comprehension. Focused attention and emotional involvement. [#Hooked] The more users (EW: voluntarily?) invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it (labor leads to love). “The IKEA effect”. [#Hooked24] Some applications store value (like data), making it less attractive to switch (gmail).

Values: [#EW] Teachers/mentors can only be inspiring if they share some of the values of their students, and are enthusiastic in their area. [#Franzen131] Values (what is important) are learned and more or less fixed from age 10, though their relative importance can grow or diminish through life. Are connected to affect. Values usually compete. Ten basic values: self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition, benevolence, universalism (taking care of the wider world). Values can me more or less close to one another. Clusters of values: the curious, the pleasure-seekers, the intimacy-seekers, the strebers, the traditionalists, and the altruists. [#NRC160811] Naming values explicitly and describing why they find those important makes unconfident people more confident. [#NS220912] There is a difference between trivial values and sacred values: if you try to bribe someone to disavow: “I am a pepsi drinker”, brain regions involved in calculating costs and benefits light up. “I am not willing to kill an innocent human being” however activates regions that play a role in retrieving rules. So seem absolute and binding moral commandments. Spending more time in rituals makes people more likely to consider both religious and non-religious values as sacred. Perception that your group is under threat enhances this effect. Rituals fuse sense of self with group membership (amongst others due to synchronized activity, like chanting or marching). Shared suffering, pain and fear may also work. [#Weiner92] One should always consider the context of a value: Chinese are big risk takers – in gambling and in traffic. In entrepreneurship? Generally a bit less. [#Seligm230] What we value may be kind of Pavlovian conditioning + things we are biologically conditioned to like/learn (fear of spiders: easy to learn, hard to extinguish, possible irrationality “cathexis”). So event + positive experiences. [#Schmid30/EW] Would values be necessary to make tough decisions?

Van 't Hoff, Jacobus: [#Strien37] As a student, worked for a while for Kekule.

Van den Ende-rules: [#Int04112011] You need three things: talent (ability to sing, act, write, etc.), social talent (can you handle people), and discipline (you need to work hard to achieve something). Then you need all three ready and prepared when fortune walks by.

Vanity: [#Tonn17] Stars need to be a bit vain, they need to be convinced that others find them important {EW: so kind of 'probability of success?'} [#Hargit37] Even scientists can be vain, like Neumann and Karman adding 'von' in front of their last name.

Variability: [#EricB251] Experts perform with less variability than novices (automation? Greater control? Greater mental resolution/more accurate mapping?), at least in motor skills. [#EricB480] Note that experts have less unintentional variability; their performance varies very well with the demands of the situation (they are flexible/adaptive). [#Schm214] Variability of practice is good! Even works for texts (outline with different structure than [#McGon96] Reducing variability helps: if you have to smoke as many cigarettes tomorrow as today, every cigarette takes extra weight (do I want this behaviour for every day for the rest of the year?) [#Hooked8] introducing variability amplifies the normal dopamine levels when the brain is expecting a reward (amplifying the focused state that suppresses brain parts associated with judgment and reason, and activating the parts associated with wanting and desire). Note that many products (like Farmville) have limited variability – people will lose interest unless the company stays on its toes.

Variable reinforcement conditioning: [#EW] More effective than constant reinforcement conditioning. Would it also have similar mechanisms to spaced (extending) learning versus blocked learning?

Variance truncation: [#EricB323] By only selecting highly eminent individuals, it is possible that some variables do not differ much between them, causing low correlation (if all are very intelligent, differences in intelligence may not seem to matter much at all). Essentially, the problem is that there is no 'control group'.

Variety: [#Lyubom282] People tend to seek variety in their behaviour. That also goes for things like dieting regimes, which need to change every 6 months or such. [#Catmul215] You may need to vary procedures, for example for the ‘postmortem’-debates, as people tend to adapt and avoid unpleasant things – which need to be discussed anyway.

Venues: [#Hargit129] Best venues for research seem to have freedom, democracy, and an informalty of interactions. Though some 'lesser' venues may have advantages if they encourage informality and irreverence. Having no people to talk to about your research makes it really hard to judge their value. [#133] 'Gods' of molecular biology treated everyone equally, but were also very forthright; you learned not to say anything superfluous or stupid. Most important lessons were to learn to engage in a discussion with anyone, and if you did, to be rigorous in your thinking and accept criticism without taking it personally. [#Hargit135] LMB: policy was to select good people and let them do what they wanted, Sanger even encouraging one to do the thing he wanted to do “if it's difficult, go for it!” [#139] Rigid atmosphere in French Academia, especially universities, may be one of main obstacles for French Nobel prizes. Italy is even worse. [#Hargit142] College of Chemistry at Berkeley was inspiring place. Faculty meeting in the hall would be discussing a topic that had not been quite resolved or a puzzling observation that had been made. Not only enthusiasm for the subject, but also frankness in admitting the limits of their understanding and their willingness to learn from each other. Little pretense, people didn't feel they had to impress each other. Caltech used to be a provincial engineering school, and it only took a few individuals and a few decades to convert it into a world-renowned research institution. Interestingly, Russian leadership in the 1920s found science important, so many from all across the country contributed. (though authorities also gave quite some independence to young researchers).

Verbal: [#Eyse] Many creativity measures are verbal, which are probably correlated to g since you need a big vocabulary which is closely correlated to IQ (at least verbal IQ, but the different IQs are correlated). [#Gall52] Using verbal instructions to transfer motor skill will generally fail if the receiving person is not already in possession of that (or a similar) motor skill. Words and movements are stored at very different places in the brain.

Verbalization: [#EricB226] Verbalization (at least in some cases!) improves both performance and transfer {EW: could this be one aspect of why geniuses wrote so much?} May depend on kind of verbalization and prompts though... {EW: greater or more elaborate activation?} Effect can be explained by experimenters asking 'why' and the detailed content of their thoughts (mere thinking aloud does not change things). Comprehension, memory and learning improves. [#Ster194] Conscious verbalization may diminish the ability to solve insight problems though not on analytical, non-insight problems.

Verrochio: [#Weiner110] Was the Arnold Sommerfeld of art. Also allowed his students (like Leonardo) to do real tasks, as making part of painting.

Versatility: [#SimonB60] Of 2102 geniuses, 61% was eminent in only one domain and field, 15% in more than one subdomain within a domain, and 24% were eminent in more than one domain.

Vervaet, Ewald: [#inet] Physicist turned psychologist, 'fighting' positivist psychologists worshipping badly-validated numbers.

Veto window: [NS160116ImpulsiveYouLackFreeWont] There is a window between becoming aware of an impulse and executing it, the 'veto window'. People with Tourette's syndrome or schizophrenia

Vice: [#EW] May vices make you 'stupider' since they increase arousal and thereby lower self-control and rational thought?

Video games: [#NS211213] Violent video games increase pain tolerance, perhaps by activating the FFF response. [Cursing works similarly, but if people curse habitually, the effect is less]

Violence: [#NS220912] Collectivist societies may be more likely to be violent as people's sense of self is more intimately tied to the group, encouraging them to draw sharp distinctions between those in their group and those not in their group. Others of your group are more like extensions of yourself. Insulting them.... [#NS221114] Humans seem to deplete resources faster ifgiven the possibility of violent control. [#NS17-514TreatViolenceLikeAPlague] Violence spreads not only through mirror neurons that can make witnesses more likely to become perpetrators, but also in late puberty by needing peer acceptance, being rejected being similar to experiencing physical pain. Shootings can be interrupted by distracting the potential shooter, making them see the situation from the perspective of their own parent or child, and make them realize it is socially safe not to shoot. Also organize social objection/protests from their own community.

Viral: [#NS191209] Videos can go viral on youtube if you (or others) send them to their friends and colleagues. Sort of gossip “this is cool, so I am cool too”

Virtual reality: [LectureRotterdam] Can be used to calm down patients before an operation – VR in the artic can make kids less sensitive to hot pain. Can also be used against fear of heights or fear of flying. Can also be used to discover new information (walking over Mars landscape) or collaborate effectively with remote experts. Perhaps augmented reality also useful for training experts by emphasizing salient features. Might VR also help to get a faster overview (structure of computer program?)

Virtue regulation: [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200906/after-especially-good-deed-are-you-destined-sin] After we have written about good deeds about ourselves (not others) we become less likely to donate something to charity; writing about our own selfish behaviour does the opposite. Seems moral licensing, but there may be an effect that we want to maintain our 'goodness homeostatis', and that feeling too good feels uncomfortable (are we taken advantage of? Are we thinking of ourselves enough?)

Virtues: [#HaidtH160] Virtue resides in a well-trained elephant. Daily practice, plenty of repetition.

Visibility: [#Levi102] How visible a job is (in Levitt's example: a gang boss). The visibility of a job influences the number of people who want to do it/enter the field, next to lucrativity.

Vision: [#Howe60] George Stephenson had vision, and was even willing to forego personal financial gain to make it come true. [#NS301010] Children learn to assume that light comes from above gradually; it doesn't seem innate (so when judging an object convex or concave) [#Stalla16] People must be motivated by the organisation’s mission, united by its values, proud of its reputation. [#EW] Vision is not just what you say (see Kai), but also what you do, the choices that you make.

Visionaries: [#Isaacson475] Visionaries need to understand and find(befriend?) people who can do things. Also need to be – at least to some degree – product people. Need to be both visionary and collaborative enough.

Visual imagery: [#EricB554] One of the five common factors of “arithmetical prodigies”. Though others have concluded that auditory memory types are involved! {According to EricB560, it is however visual imagination that is invoked for calculations} [#Kluw168] Seeing pictures may be (slightly) more effective than imagining pictures {but in schools, you don't always have the pictures available} [#Simonton52] Extensively used by Faraday.

Visual thinking: [#Root] Visual thinking, like verbal/auditory patterns and kinesthetic feelings are correlated with impact ratio, and visual thinking with the citation cluster.

Visualisation: [#EW/NS?] Visualing something activates the right muscle fibers; imagining doing something in a particular situation (or imagining doing something at all) may increase the chance that you'd actually do it {EW: whether it'd be approaching a girl or cheat on a test? May explain the perfidious interview-effect} {may visualizing/Sheriff also increase the chance that you are willing to do the necessary work?} [#Pino51] Visualizing helps remembering. [#Riobi214] Also for learning dancing/sports etc. [#Hatt49] Visualizing before starting on a motor task enhances concentration (and possibly learning?) [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczT-GYJ9wY&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=6] Best way to use visualisation is NOT to imagine having reached the goal, but imagining greatest challenges and how you'd handle that situation. [#Laird128/EW] Would visualisation (or other imaginings) activate the same part of the brain as the real thing, and have the same learning effect? [#NS080613] Making avatars of the voices in the heads of schizophrenics and abusing the patients (but becoming more supportive later) helps improve symptoms. [#Burkem27] Positive visualisation may reduce motivation: visualizing having a particularly high-achieving week at work makes people achieve less than those merely asked to think about their next working week. Basically, positive visualisation makes people relax, as if their goal has already been achieved [EW: note that sometimes some relaxation is needed for creativity, as Peale's frantic brainstorming session showed] [#EW: could visualisation excite emotions, like visualizing IM can scare me better?] [#Burkem33] “Negative visualisation” / 'premeditation of evils' may help calm the mind, bit like the Carrier method.

Visuals: [#Clar36] Visuals improve learning, at least for those with not much prior experience; people with prior experiences can create the visuals in their heads. But the visuals need to be relevant to the learning objective. [#Clar105] Spatial data, especially complex spatial data, is better represented by visuals than text (for simple spatial data it doesn't seem to matter, as the tranform from text->visual is automatic and fast) [#Clar174] Visuals can be decorative or explanatory, explanatory visuals are subdivided into representative visuals (appearance of object), organizational visuals (diagrams), transformational visuals (changes over time) and interpretive visuals (make intangible phenomena visual and concrete) ?relational visuals= graphs. Visuals are especially strong in connecting lesson ideas, as well as promoting dual encoding.

Visuo-spatial skill: [#EricB348] Visuo-spatial skill seems to be one of the few determinants of surgical skill; college grades and manual dexterity do not (suggesting that planning is more important than the actual execution of the moves). However, it seems that after some training the difference disappears (so only less learning speed, no difference in expertise achieved).

Vitamins versus painkillers: [#Hooked32] In marketing: painkillers address an obvious need, have a quantifyable market. Investors like them much more than vitamins, which address a user's emotional rather than functional needs.

Vocabulary: [#NRC220610] At the end of primary school, children know about 15,000 words; adults know 50,000 to 70,000 words. Reaction speeds increase if the word has a large family (werk- werkster), or if the word is very frequent, it decreases if the word has many neighbours which differ by 1 letter (kat ? kam, mat, etc.) [#NS291011TurningOnTheTVDoesNotTurnOffAToddlersBrain] Certain TV shows improve kid's vocabulary, especially if they are narrative or talk directly to the audience (Dora the explorer). Sesame street did not work that well, since the sketches were too short, reducing the chance that kids understood enough aboyt the situation to learn from it (possibly too few repetitions of words as well? Or too few links? [#NS281115It'sNotARocketIt'sAnUpGoer] Would limiting vocabulary to say the 1000 most common words, like Randall Munroe did “Thing Explainer” train abstraction and help creativity?

Voice: [#NS130713] We also judge on voice; we're good at assigning gender (though that's not only pitch, but also through pronounciation of some syllables), age ok, length within 10 cm. Deeper voice makes people sound more powerful and assertive (and earns CEOs 190,000 dollar more per year). Very young children prefer people with their accents, disregarding of race (shifts to race later) – note that parents are not as strict on not discriminating on accent. Women's voices have gotten 50 Hz lower the last number of years in emancipated countries. People with accents have greater chance to be found guilty in court, and we trust less of what they say. After mimicking the other person's accent, you will find the accent more attractive

Voice recorder: [#Pino81] Would speaking your homework into your voice recorder increase retention rate four-fold?

Volunteer work: [#HaidtH174] In adolescents: reduces delinquency and behavioral problems, increase civic participation, and increase commitment to positive social values. However, it does not have much effect on self-esteem or happiness. Adults do gain happiness and well-being from volunteer work, and elderly do not only gain happiness, but also longer life! Effects can be explained through social relationships and construction of one’s life story.

Von Restorff effect: [#Bran/wiki] People remembering something better if it sticks out 'like a sore thumb' from the others.

VR Body: [#NS200713] Being in the VR body of a 4-year old exaberates guesses of size of objects more than simply being scaled down.

Wajima: [#NRC] Found increase in IQ of children whose working memory he trained.

Walk in the woods-method: [#Weng54] If you have a problem, take a walk and then let objects catch your eye, one of them may give you the right idea.

Walking: [#Weiner22] Walking, whether outdoor or on a threadmill, for 5-16 minutes makes one generate twice as much creative (divergent thinking) responses as sitting.

Wallace, Alfred Russel: [#NS091113] Wrote & received over 3800 letters. Also had many interests outside natural science, from socialism and spiritualism to land reform and gardening. Notebook: part diary, part field notes, part log of each day's collecting. Pages dilled with observations, beautiful drawings and daily tallens of specimens. But also where he wrote his thoughts, analyzed papers and developed his evolutionary ideas.

Wander: [#http://www.nature.com/news/why-great-ideas-come-when-you-aren-t-trying-1.10678] Solving a problem is improved (of four conditions: no break, 12 min rest, 12 min reaction time-mind wandering task, 12 min attention-hogging memory task) by mind-wandering task [how does it work?] Does not work if the problem has not been chewed upon before.

Waste: [#Suther13] Eliminating waste should be a business' first objective. Waste and impediments are nearly criminal.

Watson and Crick: [#EricB782] Watson and Crick did not succeed where Wilkins and Pauling failed because they had some 'creative spark', but because they had gathered more relevant knowledge! [#Hargit58] Were not that great at following literature, so missed Chargaff's observation.

Watson, James: [#Hargitvii] Went to indiana because Nobel Prize had been awarded to Muller there, but found (personality or) at least research of Luria and Sonnenborn more to his liking, as that was an exciting field. Still, learned a lot from Muller's lectures (and was inspired). Muller was also human, more at ease with the past than with moving to the future. Watson had no choice but to gamble, to get to the top, set a big objective. Was rather obsessive about DNA after his period in Indiana. [#Hargit59] Learned the necessary knowledge as the need arose along the way. "...Never do anything that bores you. My experience in science is that someone is always telling you to do things that leave you flat. Bad idea. I'm not good enough to do well something I dislike. In fact, I find it hard enough to do well something that I like." James Watson. James Watson, "Succeeding in Science: Some Rules of Thumb", Science, 261, 24 (September 1993): 1812. September 1993. [#Watson1812] Inspired by booklet “What is life” by Erwin Schrodinger which claimed gene as basis of life. Had been avid birdwatcher until then. Got turned down from Caltech but went to Indiana instead, where he met Luria. Thinks one needs to combine intelligence with a willingness not to follow conventions when they block your path forward. Even started doing things differently from Luria before finishing his PhD. Rule 1: avoid dumb people, always turn to people brighter than yourself. Rule 2: take risks, be prepared to get into deep trouble. There will always be people telling you that you are not prepared for something. Rule 3: have a fallback, someone who is willing to support you when you are in big shit. Rule 4: have fun and stay connected. Have people you can go to for intellectual help – Crick went to philosopher-mathematician George Kreisel. Franklin found smalltalk awkward. Pauling could only talk to his wife (all other people were afraid to him), who only reinforced his ego which is not what you need in life. It's very hard to succeed in science if you don't want to be with other scientists – you have to go to key meetings to spot key facts that would have otherwise escaped you. And you have to chat with your competitors, even if you find them objectionable. I did that a lot. I knew almost everyone I needed to know no matter whether they exuded goodness or badness.And it paid off. So my final rule is: if you can't stand to be with your real peers, get out of science. [#strien245] May have used his pretty sister to influence Wilkins.

Way: [#EW] Having a strong clear goal is important; it helps if a way is clear too, though (even if human imagination can provide as much) [#http://www.vkbanen.nl/onderwijs/762611/Domme-prikkels.html?utm_source=onderwijsnieuwsbrief&utm_medium=nieuwsbrief&utm_campaign=20100526] Promising kids 50 dollar per test passed didn't work, simply because the children did not know HOW to achieve it!

Weak vs strong methods in AI: [#EricB43] Weak methods use general problem solving strategies (like EAs). This makes them very generally applicable, but relatively inefficient in specific domains, in contrast to 'strong' methods which use domain-specific knowledge and heuristics.

Weakest link: [#NS28012012] The weakest links in your network give you the most information, as your 'strong links' are more likely to be in your environment and encounter the same information as you do.

Wealth: [#Howe154] Wealth allows people (like Darwin) false starts, they need not be child prodigies to do well as adults (though a stimulating and supportive environment are still very beneficial). [#EW] Higher GDP seems however to correlate with lower amounts of engineers. Would less problematic childhoods, where there are few frustrations, not develop the creative and inquisitive mind? Why would you think if you already have everything? {children are being entertained instead of learning to entertain themselves?} [#Seligm223] In richter nations, depression and anxiety are relatively higher, and social connectedness is lower.

Weapon focus: [#Wolt46] High emotional excitement leads to narrowing the attention, and worse remembering of peripheral details.

Wedgwood, Pam: [http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/11/piano.teacher.pam.westwood] My aim from the very first lesson is to make piano playing fun. Introducing different styles as soon as possible and teaching pupils music they actually want to play is a key factor in keeping enthusiasm up. “Throughout the lesson, even when I play notes that are clearly wrong, Pam is encouraging and supportive.” I never normally insist on pupils practising; the motivation should come from the desire to want to play. In today's society we are all rushing around doing far too many things, so playing has to fit in around everything else. I'd advise you play little and often, which is a good recipe for success. But the more you improve, the more you'll want to learn."

Weekend school: [#NRC170513] Makes children more self-assured, seems to help their confidence in networking (as they are more regularly talking and asking questions of Maxima or the director of Shell), though can't couple their talents to a profession.

WEIRD: [#NS131110] WEIRD people perceive the world differently: visual illusions due to experience, but also language egocentric (relative to me) instead of relative to compass or other objects. Allocentric frame of reference more usual in small societies, egocentric frame may be more recent. Also westerners perceive themselves as existing more like autonomous individuals than people from East Asia, who see themselves as inseparable components of a larger community. Westerners think more analytically, focusing on categories and laws; Eaterners more holistically, paying more attention to patterns and context.

Well-being: [#PinkDrive141] Spending money on other people or on causes instead of material goods for yourself increases your subjective well-being. Having profit goals actually decreases your well-being, even if you reach your goals. [#Drive143] Better have purpose goals (to help, to learn, to grow). [#Davidson230] Well-being therapy: every day for a week write down one of your own positive characteristics and one positive characteristic of someone you regularly interact with (3x a day); express gratitude regularly, look other in the eyes when you do so; keep up gratitude diary, also noting in the diary whenever you felt a genuine connection [do the same for complimenting]. Other exercise: fill your workspace/home with pictures of important people/happy times in your life / places you associate with positive feelings/goals? - and change them weekly so you don't get habituated to them. [#Seligm240] Well-being is not the only thing people (should?) value – also justice, democracy, peace and tolerance [EW: though that may be control or lack of things that negatively impact our well-being].

Wellness: [#NS210215UnderTheWhipOfWellness=>TheWellnessSyndrome] People who are asked to think about the importance of happiness become less happy, people who focus highly on well-being also become more judgmental, seeing those who do not as 'disgusting'

Wely, Loek van: [#Busa15] Considers extreme motivation, even obsession, as most important in reaching big successes. Cares enormously about winning/losing (tends to blame his wife!) Still has the hunger for more, not satisfied. Does not only play chess however (also plays tennis). Had teacher in high school who stimulated him. Bit of shock round 18, when progress slowed and he started to get real challenging opponents. Ascribes his prestations to energy and mental resilience (and, of course, his talent. He kind of underplays his practice) {believes in talent, but has somewhat fixed mindset, blaming others} Believes that passion is most important, everything has to make way for that. Wely wants to win, more than knowing how nice chess is. Wants to win at everything, even games [!fixed mindset!]. Considers himself a fighter. Was punished for losing games as a child by having to walk home. Thinks that character is most important for success: first select the fighters, then let them find a proper sport to excel in.

Wesley: [#GladT?] Wesley was a religious reformer who discovered that lasting changes in people's lives (religious, in his case) could only be effected by letting the group convene regularly and kick people who did not conform to the rules.

Wheeler, John Archibald: assigned a term paper instead of a final exam. Stirred interest of G. David  Forney [Spectrum.IEEE, May 2016 Modem Maestro] (note that Forney himself before Wheeler's course was not really hellbent on becoming an engineer).

Whitehead: [#Bloo426] Famous educational psychologist. Subdivided the stages of learning into romance (excitement, playing, unsystematic), precision (skills), and generalization (skills+pleasure, mastery)

Whole-task: [http://www.ict-educatief.nl/sites/default/files/oratietekst_JanvanBruggen.pdf] Current learning paradigm, that you should not just practice part-tasks, but first show the entire context.

Whorf: [#Robi150] Would learning a language also include learning a way of speaking, thinking and making contact with others {EW: learning Spanish/Japanese? And would that influence the creativity of expatriates?} [#Evans194/EW] Part of language is that we can observe with more precision (greeks: light blue vs dark blue; EW: learned by stamp collectors) or have different associations, embodied (Chinese time moves down), or gender (German vs Spanish apple), or whatever. Language influences thought, already before things are put into words.

Why: [#Dwec90] Asking 'why' (for example why a football player does this or that) gets you interested in makes you an expert (for example, in predicting the football player's next move). [#SellHuman152] Asking 'why' five times may help very much to clarify a problem. [#McGon91] Asking yourself why you have resisted a temptation helps against the licensing effect. Ask “what were the reasons” instead of “why”, less defensiveness. [#Hooked53] Ask why people really do what they do (watch cat videos). What pain do those products solve?

Width: [#Root] most eminent scientists had and have wide interests, even as a child {EW: does this correlate to the large amounts of reading?}

Wigner, Eugene: [#Hargit217] At some point Wigner put his foot down and refused to move with the progress in physics. Was also stubbornly conservative, disbelieving that there were any poor people in the U.S.

Wijdeveld, Paul: [#04022013] Zijn er mensen die meer gaan voor genot en anderen die meer gaan voor erkenning door anderen of trots? <zou trots een geinternaliseerde vorm zijn van sociale steun door anderen>. Vraag: is motivatie altijd afhankelijk van positieve feedback? Paul heeft ook het probleem dat hij nog niet met pensioen kan, en het niet leuk vindt dat hij moet leveren wat de klant vraagt in plaats van wat de klant nodig heeft (mama odie- dig a little deeper, misschien dat Paul dat leuk vindt). Wetenschapsgroei als sociaal en kristallisatieproces; toeval waar de kristallen/vakgebieden onstaan. Wel in/outgroep. Beknelt de wetenschap zichzelf daar niet mee omdat interdisciplinair onderzoek er moeilijker door wordt? De werkelijkheid houdt zich niet aan de grenzen van vakgebieden. Paul verwacht ook veel van primatenonderzoek, onderzoek hersenfunctie. (misschien boek van Davidson leuk voor hem?) Hoe zou ik Paul kunnen helpen (als hij nog literatuur heeft over motivatie). Moeten mensen wel gelukkig zijn/geluk najagen (en was Michael Jackson soms toch niet echt gelukkig?). Wantrouwt sociologisch/psychologisch onderzoek (vroeg literatuurreferenties Nettle) – vaak willen mensen iets bewijzen en passen ze de methodologie daaraan aan. Voelt zich niet in controle (deed af en toe iets wat ik waardevol vond – misschien bij hem zijn fotografie)

Wilderness programs: [#Steel139] Improve self-confidence {Wim?}

Williamon: [#EricB460] Edited a book on the music education research.

Williams syndrome: [#Nelissen175] People with Williams syndrome have a defective link between the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala; they recognize burning houses as dangerous, but not angry faces as dangerous.

Willpower: [#EWL] Ivan Lendl didn't have much willpower, he had habits. [#Robi138] Even if you're handicapped, like the painter with a paralyzed body, you can find a way if you really love a goal. [#EWL] Willpower/energy may be the limiting factor in studying for excellence; an amount is needed to concentrate and keep concentration on any task {such as thinking for musical lines}, especially if other tasks are more attractive {EWL: look up New Scientist?} Refreshed by sugar or sleep (negotiations?). Would exercise help willpower? {study results boys} or not {smarter brain?} [#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/200911/willpower-tips-thanksgiving] Can be restored by just a few minutes of slow breathing (4-8 breaths/minute) [Steel85] Habits and rituals bypass the prefrontal cortex, and can therefore be very powerful agents for good and for bad; we act on cues and can become 'emotionally hijacked'. Our eating routines are based more on context (plate size) than on real hunger.[#http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201204/five-temptations-actually-boost-your-willpower] Can also be restored by witnessing (or thinking of) other people exercise their willpower/overcoming obstacles. Humorous videos (youtube?) also work, as will a small dose of caffeine. [#McGoni4] The best way to increase willpower is to learn how and why you lose self-control. [#McGoni10] There are three different versions: I will-power, I won't power and I want-power, which may not be equally strong. Willpower in upper side of left prefrontal cortex, won't power on right side, wantpower a bit lower and in middle of the prefrontal cortex[#..18] Naming your impulsive self (like 'the Cookie-monster' or 'Mr Whine') can help you diminish their power over you. [#..20] The brain always defaults to what is easiest. Distraction also makes it more likely that you give in to temptation [so more working memory for more willpower?] [#..48] Sometimes you must see a problem not as a willpower-problem, but as a won't or want-power challenge. [#..51] Stress also hampers willpower. [#..57]  Trying to fit into a corporate culture that doesn't fit your values or trying to impress a date both exhaust the same resource as willpower. Fighting an impulse, filtering out distractions, weigh competing goals, or make yourself do something difficult also depletes it. Exercising willpower decreases your ability to do things, like your physical strength. Schedule your “I will challenge” for the time when you have most strength (if you never seem to have time or energy for it). Willpower may not depend on absolute blood glucose levels, but in the change therein. (higher glucose: optimism! More willpower!) Trick to learn more willpower: do for several weeks something like working on your posture or brushing with your non-dominant hand; challenge without angst. Creating and meeting self-imposed deadlines (clean your closet) may also help. Even the promise that practice will improve performance on a difficult task can increase endurance ('where there's a want, there is a way). Find your biggest want power, and bring it to your mind when you feel weak! [#..78] With willpower exhausted, we may have values, but will generally not act on them, [#..165] When temptation strikes, see the long-term rewards very clearly before you; are you willing to give that up for the short-term reward? [#50] Relaxation (lying + progressive, 5-10 min) can also help counteract stress and increase willpower. [#NRC300614] You can save willpower on choices by clearly spelling out the options and consequences: Do I take this cookie now or not?” costs more willpower than “do I take this cookie and weigh more tomorrow, or do I let this cookie lie and weigh less tomorrow” [#Haidt18] Instead of willpower, try look away, or think of something more enjoyable, or focus on negative aspects of something. [#NS090917Don’t quit now: Why you have more willpower than you think] People who believe willpower is unlimited or think that it is energizing to be absorbed in a demanding mental task basically seem to have unlimited willpower (?!) Basically brain can be fooled by gargling with sugared water. Pay yourself a lump sum at the beginning of a task, then fine yourself it you fall short of your goals. Subliminal messages (sticky notes) also work

Wilson, Edward O: [#Wilson] Found his mentors very important (dedicates his book to their memory). As a 14-year-old collected ants and butterflies in the swamps, and had a menagerie of snakes and black widow spiders at home. Was also boyscout eager to win his eagle batch (ambition? Group work?) Due to war-time shortage of young men was asked to become nature counselor of a camp, directing other boys to collect snakes. Became very popular at camp. Didn't do much at school. Was first of family to attend college (University of Alabama). Had shifted at 17 to interest in ants, wanted to become an entomologist, and then strove for As, which he didn't find very hard. Soaked up all elementary and intermediate chemistry and biology available. Did PhD at Harvard (was then already considered prodigy) and stayed there. Lesson: put passion ahead of training. Sample other subjects, acquire a general education in science, and be smart enough to switch to a greater love when one appears. But don't drift through courses in science hoping that love will come to you. Decision and hard work [EW: so passion may be fueled by hard work as well]. Most scientists think in images and facts, not maths. Himself learned calculus at age 32 (swallowing his pride, sitting in the same class as his students) “A real scientist is someone who can think about a subject while talking to his or her spouse about something else”. Ideas in science emerge most readily when some part of the world is studied for its own sake. It's far easier for scientists to find help from mathematicians than it is for mathematicians to find scientists who can use their equations. Part of biology is amassing data for its own sake. For whatever competence you have in mathematics, there is a branch of science for which that is enough to excel in. Wilson first wanted to study spear flies, but couldn't get the right literature or equipment. So turned to ants. Was good idea, since domain was sparsely inhabited [could easily make great discoveries] and still relevant [ants have really complex social systems and form lots of earth's biomass]. Of course, still do broad training, apprentice yourself to researchers and programs of high quality, and make a lots of friends of colleges of your age in science for mutual support. “March away from the sound of the guns”. Study the subject enough to become a world-class expert. “The more difficult the problem, the greater the likely importance of its solution” [EW ~] Two ways of studying: either find a problem and solve it, or study a subject widely looking for what is unknown. Note: for every problem, there is an ideal species or entity to perform research on. Also, for every species or entity, there are important applications to which it is ideally suited (bats->sonar). First strategy is more for problem solvers. Second type more for 'scientific naturalists'. Example of his approach: observation (ants dispose of their dead), what is the trigger for disposing of another ant? Asks of something: its causes, its origin, its consequences. Try to figure out a many possible alternative hypotheses as possible in advance ('multiple competing hypotheses'). A law is more something that can predict with mathematical exactitude. Recommends scenarios that end with goals (where would you like to be in 10, 20 years time, or at the end of your career) then choosing one which you wish to pursue. And to daydream a lot. Make talking silently to yourself a relaxing pastime. Give lectures to yourself on important topics that you need to understand. When science conflicts with political ideology, when the research is sound, science always comes out on top (in the end). Knows however that some dreams (extracting pheromones from amber and giving them to living ants) is too much of a circus trick and has too little chance to discover something new, so he doesn't have time for it even if he likes the idea. Sees scientific achievement as something like X discovered Y/helped develop the theory of Z. The road to the frontiers have lengthened, but the frontier is also vastly wider, with sparsely-populated areas to go. Entrepreneurship and hard work more important than intelligence; intelligence may be a detriment (Wilson has IQ of 123, two Nobel prize winners had IQs in the low 120s). Should be bright enough to see what can be done but not so bright as to become bored doing it. Considers that high IQs may have it too easy in their earlier training. [#correspond with Wilson?] Strong work ethic, even if part leads to dead ends. You will find friends among fellow-enthusiasts and experts. Thinks that daily satisfaction from what you're doing is important, as is the esteem of people you respect. Also that what you discover will uniquely benefit humanity. Recommended 40 hours teaching & admin, 10 hours of study in your field, and 10 hours for research. So take all sabbaticals and other opportunities for paid leave to do research. Avoid department-level administration beyond thesis committee chairmanships if at all fair and possible. Spend extra time with students who have talent and interest in your field, then use them as assistants for your research for your benefit and theirs. Take weekends off, but no vacations. Real scientists do not take vacations. They take field trips or temporary research fellowships in other institutions. Consider offers of institutions that offer more research time and less for teaching and administration. “Inside professors” and “outside professors”. Stay restless, continue to move intellectually in search of new problems and new opportunities. Make a steady stream of small discoveries, but stay alert for the hint of gold that can promise a major strike. Gold fever can be a good thing in a scientist. Also entrepreneurship important, ability to think of and dare to do things other people have not thought or dared. For that, perform lots of quick, easy experiments. Of course there is place for the careful experiment, but quick & easy is ideal for exploring things.Wilson himself held magnets over ant columns, sealed off metapleuretic glands. Swapping queens. [#84] Entrepreneurship also requires the character and means to start over if something fails. Don't follow the newest apparatus, as they will usually be really cumbersome in the beginning; don't specialize in a particular instrument. Use but don't love technology, and if something is difficult, try get a better-prepared collaborator. Love the project first, and simply use all means at your disposal. Thinks that real breakthroughs come from solitary minds; from people who are introverted to dislike team sports and social events, disliking authority (being told what to do) [EW: reactance -relating to personality factors] Neither a leader nor pledged by social clubs. Attention wanders easily, more a dreamer than a doer. First research is done eagerly and with no prompting. Wilson was only child, but not especially lonely. Was left to his own devices (no visits to relatives, so clubs, etc.) Enchanted by Frank Buck movies about wild animals, and read national geographic, especially about insects. [stepmother – so real mother died ? no, divorced!] Friend Ellis McLeod told him about butterfly. Got books on the subject. Even delved into college-level texts, which they could scarcely read, though they tried very hard. Considers research scientists relatively prone to introversion, openness to experience and conscientousness. Archetypes: journey to an unexplored land (find new species), search for the grail, good against evil (war against cancer). Feels that scientists are explorers (Explorer's club) of the biosphere. As 18-year old student started correspondence with a Harvard PhD student of 25, already a world authority on ants. Devotion bordering on fanaticism to science, entomology, jazz, good writing, and ants. Complimented Edward on identifying all ant species in Alabama, but urged him to study the basics, to 'get serious about ants' – especially, to find out anything about dacteline ants in Alabama – people didn't even know what they ate [so Bill knew the gaps] Bill addressed Edward as a colleague, even in training (which Edward liked). Later traced the evolution of those ants – why did some grow big, other small, some live in this kind of holes, other in that … When couldn't find a certain ant in Surinam, enlisted help of local entomologists. Was enthusiastic as a grail hunter to find the last aneuretine ants. Or to find the ancestor of all ants (or a modern equivalent) (invited two good naturalists to join the hunt [EW: also good for networking] -turned out to be a winter species!) Realizes that ant-ologists are very specialized, but sees it as different from Civil war buffs since it links to the rest of science and the world. Agreed with PhD student that she should write to leading experts of ant consortium – always good to meet and work together with such people. His student then came up with the idea of doing the classification on her own, requested postdoc with sequencing experience and later a statistician. “You try the impossible to achieve the unusual”. Know your subject, thoroughly. [Example Steven Weinberg, who worked on lots of different physics projects because he was trying to teach himself some area of physics]. Undertook huge work of taxonomy of a large ant genus; since communication was hampered by researchers not knowing what subspecies their Pheidole ant belonged to. Wilson could face failure, and started also in collaboration with his old mentor. Persisted both for challenge and for feeling of duty (project took 18 years). Found important phenomenon by simply studying all the ants and doing small experiments. 'a feel for the organism' needed. Expedition to islands to find both new species, to observe changes that happened in 55 years, and perhaps to tackle the bigger question of the formation of species and their spread across islands. Again used local experts for help. Believes that one needs more science to fight threats to biodiversity, like the fire ant [of course, he cares about biodiversity, and thinks that if there is a solution, people will actually use it]. Insect brains have less glial cells, and on average more connections than our neurons – they are much smarter per gram of brain mass than vertebrates. Important to develop broad knowledge in an area, but also develop the ability to spot blank places in that knowledge. Look for oddities, small deviations. When developing pheromone theory, first thought as an engineer (efficieny), a safety expert (privacy). Gave up when they failed to purify the compound (not knowing that a mixture of compounds was needed). P203 citaat over voortgang van wetenschap. Transformative experience when encountering work of Ernst Mayr, which suddenly made sense of so much that he knew. Was very ambitious when young, though Robert McArthur may have been even more ambitious and competitive (and low A?) McArthur came from Yale, with great mentor, G Evelyn Hutchinson. Robert and Edward both saw that biology (and the job opportunties) were shifting towards molecular biology due to its obvious importance to medicine. Elder faculty either tending their own academic gardens or aloof and in denial, blind to the threat. “Noblesse non oblige”. George Gaylord Simpson: very taciturn and withdrawn. Wilson set up committee to fight overpowering by new molecular biologists. Getting a name was the first step (group). Envy and insecurity among the drivers of scientific innovation. Define a problem as precisely as possible, and choose one if need be one or two partners to help solve it. [Solving a smaller problem may also give insights in bigger ones]. Mathematical skill and deep theory not far as important as the ability to choose an important problem and to solve it, no matter how imperfectly.

Winter, Leon de: [#PsychMagaz] Started writing after early death of father (11), still remembers when teacher fetched her colleagues to listen to his poem. Reading, writing and building models as hobby. Read a lot, though his parents never read a book. Best at primary school, but troublemaker at gymnasium, until he picked himself up when he wound up in 'punishment school'.

Wisdom: [#Root] Perhaps a polymathic background helps successful scientists compete with the others. [#HaidtH153] Wisdom consists of balancing your own needs with those of others and of the future, of adaptation (adapting yourself to the environment), shaping (changing the environment) and selection (choosing to move to a new environment). Ignorant people see everything in black and white, and are strongly influenced by their own self-interest.

Wisdom of the crowd: [#NS09062012, Why using the hive mind is nearly always best - Crowd IQ: Measuring the Intelligence of Crowdsourcing Platforms ]. 1 worker IQ of 122, 12 workers had collective IQ of 145. [#Surowiecki] Diversity and independence are vital. Diversity of ideas, diversity of buyers (perhaps someone will want it!) One can also use weighted average (Google) instead of simple averages. /would betting also make the subfield more fun?/ For many things public is better than experts – and a lot cheaper! Companies don't put collective wisdom into good use. Especially hierarchical companies have many layers that prevent the management from seeing what's going on and employees from being involved and communicating well. Taking a bunch of the most intelligent people tends not to work well since intelligent people resemble each other too much, possibly. No evidence that expertise is developable in broad fields like 'decision making' or 'strategy'. Experts are usually not 'well calibrated', overestimating their accuracy/ability by quite a lot. More interaction leads to less smart decisions. Memory biases may play a role, but also pressure to conform/herding (football coaches) “if you do the same as other people, at least you're not an idiot”. Sequential decisions can be infectious (errors, even statistical ones in the beginning are multiplied). In society, you need some people who 'go their own way'. Those are often the more overconfident people, but advantage since they are less sucked into negative information cascades. Groups are better in deciding between solutions than in inventing them {Michael?}. People are less likely to follow groups for very important decisions. Groups become smarter when rewarded for best group decision, not best individual decision (ball from urn). Specialisation and decentralization and the troubles of American Intelligence organisations. Schelling points: if you know that the other is trying to do the same, how do you make a date? For example, go to central station and be there at 12:00. Such conventions help coordination. Decision problems, coordination problems and cooperation problems. Movietheatres ignoring the laws of supply and demand. {EW: why?} Quaker's advantage in trade, part also because ingroup punished transgressors. Problems in big companies because short-term gains overwhelmed long-term payoffs of honesty, and no feedback to bad/dishonest auditors. {information flow problem?} People have to trust their neighbours, trust the government (at least for tax), and trust that the state will punish the guilty. Diversity helps decision making but is bad for coordination problems. [[Paula Stephan The Economics of Science]] Group deliberations work best when there is a clear agenda and everyone gets a chance to speak. Be wary of group polarization (groups getting all their members in more extreme positions than they started with, often this means that an entire group shifts in a certain direction) If people speak in sequence, problems are enlarged, as earliest speakers have disproportionate influence; unfortunately, high-status people and men speak earlier and more often, even if they don't have much more expertise than others. [[ Mike: write-down first, then circulate]]. Correlation between upward mobility and not telling the boss that things had gone wrong (p205). Button experiment: feeling of control mtters more than excerting the control (against noise). To prevent bubbles you need enough people to trust their own senses of real value, and not gamble on making a quick profit on guessing everyone else's. [#NS040513] Kulkarni is working on Wish, Hack, and Sketch to use the crowd to improve designs, software and images, some AI-researchers use crowd ideas and mix them in an EA-like manner.

Wishful thinking: [#CIA2] Wishful thinking (perceiving what you want to perceive) is actually not very strong, most of its effect can be explained by perceiving what one expects to perceive {EW: though really wanting something to be true, emotion, may skew expectation upwards?}

Withdrawal: [#Ster144] Withdrawal in one's ivory tower (or Proust's cork filled rooms) {EW: or Jesus' desert}is a form of sensory deprivation, which lowers cortical arousal and may enhance creativity.

Withdrawal system: [#Haidt30] Is stronger and faster than the approach system, also because the impulses get to the thalamus first, which sends them to the amygdala, which can immediately activate the flight/fright/fight response. Also signals the cortex to change your thinking, looking for threats.

Witte: [#Wittxv] The elder Witte started by naming as many objects to his son as possible, and giving him always more information about things, encouraging it to ask questions. The father answered Karl where he could, but always insisted that the best way was the student overcoming obstacles himself. Took him to as many museums as possible, stressing interrelationships {connections!} the importance of grasping first principles, and of learning everything thoroughly. Created mysteries to pique his son's curiosity, and devised games. [#Wikipedia] “This book attracted criticism and soon fell into oblivion in Germany, but in China, the book became a bestseller at beginning of the 21st century. Millions of Chinese hope that their children using Witten book to be a genius. The name "Karl Witte" is changed to "Carl Weter" when translated from Japanese.” Father Witte also stressed morality, and not feeling better than others. And also was an example of the behaviour he wanted to teach (such as industry). Fondled and praised little Carl when he pronounced a word correctly, if not, said that he could not yet pronounce the word. Parents spoke slowly and correctly and clearly/unambiguously, not “baby talk” like “moo” for cow. When child makes mistakes, reproved jestingly or given helpful hint. Took Karl to also visit zoos and different strata of society, from the opera to the death bed and the poor cabin; parents discussed with Karl or with each other in Karl's presence, and asked whether he had taken notice of this or that, and whether he had liked it. If parents didn't know something, they asked the best-instructed men to supplement their knowledge. Karl also stayed with other families for a while in the country. Witte also sought excellent teachers for his son, but could find none that would meet with his exacting standards (such as clarity and humility to look things up that they didn't know). Exercise in the open air and playing is good (even though the games can be too rough). Karl was inoculated against ego by relatively sparse praise {EW: praising effort is even better!} Mentioned virtuous men as role models, and emininent men not to make Karl feel too good about himself. Discussed flattery/compliments with his wife in Karl's presence, and emphasized that Karl only did better since he had had a far better education by their parents. Loudly, clearly, slowly and repeatedly. All objects can be used for education, even the fingers. If Karl was crying, they distracted him with something new. Kept Karl with them at all times possible, and sometimes did things wrong on purpose, berating him jokingly if he didn't notice it. Repetition (memories of journeys). Mother acted with Karl, making him occasionally the mother or the teacher or the father (and sometimes doing things wrongly, especially things that Karl did too). Karl asked his mother drawing things, his mother drew them and made up a story. Also played with building blocks. Playmates were troublesome, for they had worse habits than Karl, and seduced him to imitate them. And school would have even been worse. If Karl didn't like to eat anything he only had to eat little, but his parents gave the good example themselves and used an ad populum “everyone likes it!” Did not or rarely give Karl sweets. Karl got a bit of meat, more when he was growing a lot, but never excessively. Clear limits, YES and NO which are yes and no. Gave reasons for refusal if Karl did not know these yet. They let Karl tell what he saw in pictures, and 'pitied' him that he could not read, and that they had no time to read it to him. Started with letter blocks. Sometimes asked friends to ask Karl to read to them. !!! Also had separate play and worktime, stressing fast and good work at worktime; from the fear that only learning by play would lead someone to be bored, stifled and hopeless in a regular workplace. Book of Conduct. Did reward Karl with a little of money if he had done good work and behaved well, stopped/delayed payment on bad behaviour. Celebrated successes with Karl's favourite dishes and a little party. Funny children's stories in French were the best to get him started. Taught in light way, never fully in earnest (though complete play was too much for him), small difficulties frighten the child when the atmosphere is not relaxed {Isis?}. Did once hire a teacher for the pronunciation of English. Maintenance: 15 minute per language each day.

Woehler, Friedrich: [#Jaffe136] Studied with Berzelius, but also with Leopold Gmelin in Heidelberg. Knew the work of Chevreul and the work of Rouelle on animal chemistry. Started as medical student. Born in 1800, son of a very developed man, who once fought his master the prince. Father encouraged interest for nature in him, as well as drawing and collecting minerals. Was also allowed to work in the chemical laboratory of one of his father's friends. Friedrich was not very forgiving, never visited lectures again of professor who considered his chemical endeavours a waste of time. Endanged his own health to do research for a prize question about ureum. Drawn by the fame of Gmelin went to Heidelberg. Gmelin himself was enthusiastic about Woehler, and tried to keep him for chemistry, even sending him to Berzelius. When stuck for 6 weeks when going to Berzelius, was able to (via a friend from mineral collecting) get to work in a local lab. Was too excited to sleep before meeting Berzelius. Told him (when rushing an analysis) “That was quick, doctor, but bad” Discovered isomerism with Liebig when the created compounds with same formulas but different properties. Met Davy when with Berzelius traveling through northern Sweden. Had a communication and distance collaboration with Liebig. Went to Liebigs lab when his wife died after two years of marriage, Berzelius counseled to call the group they found proin. Good couple: Liebig impulsive, quick to anger (even at Berzelius) Woehler more careful. Also loved to paint. Also loved music and poetry. Also loved to teach students, especially as supervisor. Liebig turned to agricultural research (fertilizers) however, while Woehler went back to minerals. Also discovered Al, Be, and Y, almost V but he fell sick. Was very modest

Women in science: [#EW] <Yes, I think it's harder for a woman to make a career in science, and I think society is at least partly to blame for that. Decision of woman how much time/energy to spend to adapt to it or fight it. Individual choice; however, the ideal scientific behaviour is not 'male' or 'female' [Csiskz]. As far as I know, women can survive in academia without being traitors to womankind, [Kroon, Curie, Yonath], and by being there wedge open the discrimination and fight it more effectively than if they stay outside , easy to disempower. Yes, it isn't fair, but you still have a chance, and I think it's a decent one. [testosterone -less empathy] [male-female characteristics] [macho or barbie-you don't want to be a scientist anyway [sociologische druk-Andy-fuck de society> There are men who blame women for their unequal representation in science, those tend to get fired. There are women who blame men or the male part of society for the underrepresentation of women. For science, there seem relatively few big differences between brain and creativity, there is one significant difference, and that is agreeableness [another possible difference is risk-taking, see 'eigenwijsheid'-section]. But those work approximately the same for men and women, and can be overridden by conscious choices and learned behaviour. Goal of this workshop is help both men and women reach more of their potential in science. It can be that women will still have more problems or are discriminated against, but I think the chance will go up with more quality of science. It's up to the woman to choose whether she prefers to learn to live with this imperfect world and be successful herself, or whether to fight for a better world to enhance the chances of her daughters and fellow-females. Perhaps a mixture of both. I can just hope that having more knowledge will allow for better choices. {quite some positive role models; Marie Curie, Ada Yonath, biology-researcher; Maaike Kroon, probably others; 'Self-made men' – beware of thinking that being a man is so great, Japanese women extremely sexist society, why women tolerate? Because it could have been worse. They could have been Japanese men. Most talented young people were boys who had some characteristics of girls, and girls who had some characteristics of boys. It's about doing what is necessary for the task, whether it fits with gender-stereotypes or not}

Wontpower: [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fczT-GYJ9wY&list=PL357F81227CC1BA80&index=6] Opposite of willpower, the ability to do not do a thing. Most people are not equally good in willpower and wontpower, need different strategies. Sometimes you can convert a willpower challenge (I will go to bed on time) to a won't-power challenge, and vice versa, whatever works better.

Wooden: [#Coyl168] Legendary basketball coach. Didn't give long speeches (20 secs most). 6.8% praise, 6.6% expressions of displeasure, 75% information. A M+M-M+ (showing how something should be done, showing the wrong way, then showing the right way again) they called a “Wooden”. Also made intensity of trainings higher than that of games (the Roman sword technique). Note that Wooden each morning made a minute-by-minute schedule, and recorded the cards so he could compare them with those of last year. No detail was too small to be considered (socks). He had specific goals for the team and for the individuals. Used “whole-part”method (first demonstrating whole, then doing parts) and laws of learning (explanation, demonstration, imitation, correction, repetition)

Wooden sword: [#EW/Coyl15] The Romans practiced with heavy wooden swords, so the real iron swords would be a cinch. Similarly, Brazilians intensify their soccer training with futsal, which allows for much more frequent contact with the ball, and the small spaces enforce precise handling. [#Syed32] 'Lightning speed' Desmond Douglas became that way since table tennis room was so cramped that he had to stand at the board, and had very little time to respond.[#Syed81] “No time plus no space equals better skills”, though other ways of making performance more difficult (multiple balls at the same time, two defense persons on you, training with superior players) also work; best techniques have been carefully researched and experimented on, though.

Words: [#Higbee38] Words seem to be processed much faster than pictures (faster to read a word than to recognize a picture, faster to speak alphabet than to visualize it). Are words therefore handy shortcuts? However, pictures are remembered better {EW: more processing time?}

Wordsworth: [#Ster109] Collaborated and was supported by his sister Dorothy.

Work culture: [#C2W-101112] American work culture is less direct than Dutch one, but not 'soft': less loyalty between employees, so risk-averse behaviour. Also much more hierarcy. In Europe, people work on a good plan to build trust – in China, first build trust – don't worry, the good plan may come later.

Work ethic: [#Bloo510] Parents of talented individuals valued working hard, doing one's best in whatever one tries, work comes before play, and working towards distant goals.

Work orientation: [#Csik208] Work orientation, as measured as endurance plus achievement orientation, correlates quite well to student's commitment.

Worked examples: [#Clar102] Replacing some practice by worked examples can be very worthwhile. [#Clar265] Note that worked examples only work if they lead to deep processing, such as active comparisons of examples where surface features differ but principles remain constant. One way is to create diagrams, in which part is filled in using one example, and the other part must be filled in by using the data of another worked example. Adding heuristics and whys to worked examples may work, but not enough proof yet. [#Hatt172] Decent effects, about d=0.52.

Working backwards: [#Seth128] A technique Planck had used on Wien's law.

Working memory: [#EricB530/EW] Due to limitations in working memory, experts adapt (restarting search in chess, or using other algorithms in mental calculus). [#EricB549] Experts (at least a couple of groups of experts) seem to use visuo-spatial working memory more than verbal working memory; the reverse seems to be true for novices. [#EricB557] Calculators using paper to write down intermediate results can be faster (other algorithms?) {EW; sort of man-'machine' synergy} [#Clar52] We have separate visual and audio working memory. [#Clar80] As well as a separate executive component that decides which information to rehearse. [#Clar90] Working memory (in learning) can be bypassed by using external memory aids, such as job aids (though they need to be applicable to the job, and very well-designed), or reference-based training (usually guided by a manual with progressively more difficult tasks). Or memory support in training/work interface (such as popups). [#Kluw98] May also have a kinesthetic module. The 'feature model' assumes that overlapping features between items make items less easy to find [potato -corn, potato-basket ? remembering one and then trying to recall the other deactivates potato (and if reactivates, easily back to corn)). {EW: would the capacity of working memory be related to the switching speed?} [#Kluw214] Working memory is needed for effective inhibition of irrelevant stimuli; if the working memory load is higher, inhibition deteriorates. [#NS031211] Short term-memory allows you to recall what is in the past, working memory is what allows you to manipulate the information (like RAM in a computer which can contain instructions as well as data] Training: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/06/03/1103228108 WM training helps abstract thinking [can consider more options? Or not as easily full?] [#NS16062012] People with high working memory capacity may be less likely to solve word problems than people who are more easily distracted. [#Will111] Factual knowledge (chunking) and automated processes can gradually bypass working memory limitations by automation. [#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory] also related to attention; high WM capacity can prevent 'attentional capture' by lower systems and focus on goals. {read more in wiki?} [#NS031101] Underloading driver's working memory also makes people worse at avoiding a car crash; it's as dangerous as overloading them. [#Imagine62] 60% correlation between working memory capacity and IQ score. [#Intelligence, vol 40 p 419] Ruthzatz found that chldren with exceptional talents in music, cooking, art and language all had exceptional working memories. [EW: but useful for adults, after learning has taken place?]

Working memory overload: [#Clar52] Working memory overload may be the most important factor explaining why irrelevant facts decrease learning. So prevent overload when teaching!

Working week: [#EW/Int051012] It is weird how many people claim that their work can't be done in 40 hours. If that's true, while not delegate or lower your standards? Also striking is the observation that 'you miss experience' if you work less hard for a few years, while in reality most work does not give any experience; it's better to keep learning, so if you work less time per week, with some time for learning, your skills would be as sharp as those of harder-working colleagues. [#NS250616FutureOfWork] 20% of high-skilled people work more than 50 h/wk, through average is below 1600 h, especially due to rise in paid leave. [#NS130517BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor] If people work 55 hours a week or more, 13% more likely to develop coronary heart disease, 33% more likely to have a stroke, compared to 35-40 hours.

Worldviews: [#Hatt27] A student's learning can be enhanced or hampered by his or her worldview. [#NS040513] Children (in the US) seem to be getting more materialistic: 62% said that having lots of money was important (48% in 1976), but only 25% said they thought that hard work was important (39% in 1976). Perhaps due to advertising, since it rarely shows the work necessary to earn money to pay for products. [#Strien338] Trying to unify different worldviews, either from sciences or from persons (for example differing parents), can lead to creativity.

Worrying: [#IntSanderKoole] Worriers do better in good times than 'action-oriented' persons, in bad times they can get paralyzed, however. If worrier's self-image is also low, talking courage into them, or being touched on the arm by a female also helps, or having a teddy bear on their lap.

WPI: [#NS120316] Wise psychological interventions. In contrast to nudges, aim at changing behaviour long-term. Typical approaches are externalizing problems (like seeing reports of older students telling they struggled first, too, but that their grades got better over time), growth-mindset, and boosting sense of social belonging (reports of older students who also wrote that they had trouble making friends, but fit in better after a year or so. WPIs are about mental unblocking, removing psychological barriers to change.

Wright, Orville and Wilbur: [#Greene215] Became fanatic bicycle racers and spent all their free time assembling and disassembling their bikes and making improvements; soon friends came to them for repairs, which prompted them to open their bicycle shop. Wilbur requested all available information on aeronautics and flying machines from the Smithsonian. Also, the continual cycle between tinkering and testing for bikes turned out to be excellent for the flying machine as well. The optimal learning curve (given lack of knowledge at that time) was lots of trial-and-error [EW: if you understand a problem inside out, or feedback cannot be delivered fast, you want a more thorough approach]

Writers: [#Imagine78] Writers don't seem to are very schizophrenic, but 80% has had depressions.

Writing: [#EricB392] Both vocabulary size and diversity in word choice correlate to judgements of writing effectiveness. [#Crop32] Many great scientists were inaccessible writers, Newton's principia was much more admired than read. Though after Newton had been in society for longer outside his Cambridge seclusion, his next work (Opticks) was much more readable {EW: why?} [#EW] Would the writing of Van Gogh access his complementary hemisphere and therefore make him more creative than right-hemisphere-exclusive painters? [#Hatt142] Use of teams, peer-feedback and collaborative authorships helps in learning to write. [#Hatt225] Students learning to write on the computer are more engaged and produced work of higher length and quality than students learning to write on paper! [#59sec19] Writing about your thoughts and feelings about a subject helps you much more than talking about it, writing may create a storyline about what has happened, and work towards a solution. [#EW061111] Does writing, like consciousness, help focus the unconscious on a problem? Or just help continue a train of thought without getting distracted? [#NS10032012] Writing changes the language; there is a difference between written and spoken language, also sentence length and complexity of paragraphs changes.[EW!] [#Redirect6] Pennebaker's exercise, writing down deepest thoughts and emotions on subject and how it relates to the rest of one's life . [#Redirect57] Writing works best under two conditions: some distance from the event, so that thinking about it does not overwhelm you, and when analyzing why the event has occurred; try to observe yourself from a distance: why do you have such feelings? [http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/home2000/writingandhealth.html]  [#NS300515] We tend to read the worst in written messages because they offer so few emotional cues. Still we believe that if we write e-mails, we are clear.This effect is amplified if the message is received from someone of higher status. [#Lyubom169] The effect of writing on trauma processing is greater the more causal words (‘infer’) and understanding words (‘understand’) are used.

Wyss-institute: [#C2W070214, Donald Ingber] Just has large subsidy, no grants. Employs most crazy, original and 'foolish' people, and brings them together. Also people from industry are extremely handy – hired people with 10 or 20 years experience in product development, who became responsible for valorisation of the research. Not all people like bringing disciplines together (but presumably hired those who did). Wyss was not able to make his company take risks or do innovation, academics are innovative, but just publish papers. PhDs and postdocs get wonderful results, but can never commercialize it. Industry people can, and that gives positive feedback to the postdoc. [Ingber collaborated with George Whitesides]

X-ray-vision conceit: [#EW240713] The idea that we see people as they 'truly are' and that we judge people on their true worth instead of tricks, clothes and beauty. Note that we also hate feeling manipulated.

Xerxes-effect: [#EWL] The theory that being in comfortable circumstances decreases performance (or curiosity?). Actually, the only decreaser of productivity found for scientists is a few years after marriage and children and even then they still can do Nobel-prize winning research {EW: should check that, but probably yes}. {linked to Orphans-effect?} {'Karakter'- Bordewijk?}

Yang, Chen Ning: Father mathematcian, visited US for graduate studies. Returned when CN was six. Family moved to Xiamen, father taught him English, arithmetic and Tang poetry. Moved to Beijing at age 7, showed promise in primary school. Friends with later artist. Boarded at middle school, father hired teacher to teach him Mencius. Told his parents that he would receive Nobel Prize after reading book on universe (age 13). Family moved back to Hefei due to bombardment, fled to Kunming. Also took freshman course in Chinese literature. First majoring in chemistry, then switching to physics (age 16). Mentioned teachers. Home again hit by bomb (you are not sure of your life). Graduated under Wu Ta-you at age 20, enrolled in graduate school; won Fellowhsip for US. Master degree thesis at age 22, professor J.S. Wang. Flew to calcutta, then went to US (troop ship). First tried experimental thesis under S.K. Allison (failed). Edward Teller supervised PhD on angular distributions. (1948). Then was assistant to Enrico Fermi for a year, then moved to IAS in Princeton, married 1950. 1956 most improtant paper, parity nonconservation. [#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3hZ8jnqXg] Seems to have really good and precise memory (nov 24 arrival in US, 5000 tonne ship). Knew that UoC had best physics department in the world. Oppenheimer visited Chicago, gave lecture on hottest topic, renormalisation. Princeton had most experts on renormalisation, Yang went there for 1 year postdoc. IAS: not being bothered by committee work, not being bothered by graduate students. Oppenheimer offered him succession, but Yang “I think about it for a few days” - did not feel administrative type. Wrote that he would not enjoy the life of a director. Was once invited over by Einstein (had read Yang's paper in physical review), but Einstein did not work on things that interested young physicists anymore. Apparently still read things, but was behind the curve/solidified. Didn't know the Yang-Mills thing would become so important – just thought it beautiful. When lecturing a few years later on general relativity, saw the similarities between tensor and Yang-Mills [EW: had not regularly regurgitated his basics, like Fermi]; went to mathematician for help, got indecipherable book. Finally got mathematician to give lunchtime lectures. Gave thankyou gift. Anywaym Yang knew quite some mathematicians, also from MIT and other institutes <49:31> Professors in China were devoted and responsible, going into great depths, covering large areas. Chose theoretical physics perhaps in part because he had too little knowledge of it to be effective [chose it however to broaden his knowledge!]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVWlapujbfo. His acquaintance (James Simons) knows Wheeler's worlk + mentions something seldom looked at: geometry of space at extremely small scales. JS was fired for giving an interview, though real reason may have been disagreeing with his boss in public (the newspaper) [48:29] Was smart, and knew that CIA could trap him by seeing secret documents, so got his secretary to come in and watch. Called NSF immediately afterwards. Some discoveries became only important 10 or 20 years later. His advice: do not always follow fashion. Have one's own focus. 2. Work on both big and small problems. Only big-fail or even become psychotic.3. Look for topics that have direct connections with physical phenomena or with the basic structure of physics. Though even Yang had failures, for example not recognizing the importance of symmetry breaking. Likes exploring new territories and ideas. Not always good, but comes naturally to him. 3 Ps in research: perception, persistence and power. Perception and power most important. Nurture one's intuition, and sharpen it if it contradicts new discoveries. But also believe in it. Don't easily believe other's words. Yang is an exemplar of sincerity, honesty and integrity. “Better slow and stready, not flughty and tricky; better plain and honest, not flowery and showy” Attitude towards research and papers. Yang only had very few graduate students, steered Chao towards accelerator theory since the problem/physicist ratio was much better there.

Yawning: [#NS160313] Contagious yawning develops around age 4 to 5, is linked to sociality, children starting to attribute mental states to themselves and others.

Ye, Kai: [#Jurre] Kai always has lots of ideas, is creative, and acts upon his ideas.

Yerkes-Dodson law: there is an optimum level of motivation for any task, but for complex tasks that optimum lies lower than for simple tasks {EW: perhaps because one needs lower arousal to get better ideas}.

Yes, and: [#SellHuman195] Technique from improv that may help understand the other/negotiate.

Yoga: [#NS240617YogaMayRelaxInflammationGenes] Yoga and other mind-body techniques (like tai chi and qigong) make genes related to inflammation less active.

Yonath, Ada: [#http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368_supp/full/478S6a.html] Nobel-prize winner, came from poor family, father died when 11. Has broad interests and wandering mind (can talk about polar bears, for example) “My mind is usually wandering around — I read one thing and think about related subjects. My ideas are always bubbling under the surface and inspiration can strike from any source.” “Survival in life gave me a lot of persistence and resistance to keep going and actually solve my problems. And it helped me put things in proportion.” What kind of attitudes and qualities should a young scientist develop?Be curious — that is most important. Take passion. Be ready to sometimes experience difficulties, but enjoy what you are doing. In other words: be tough, and love your work. [wiki] Was inspired by Marie Curie and read extensively about her, but Curie was not her role model. Father was rabbi, young Ada kept herself occupied by reading books, education was very important in her family, was sent to very good high school even if family couldn't pay tuition. While a postdoc at MIT she spent some time in the lab of subsequent 1976 chemistry Nobel Prize winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. of Harvard University . Helped support mother and younger sister [!had no brother! -Marie Curie though did] [#AnnelienZweemer] Found being 'granny of the year' and 'scientist of the year' equally important.

You are not safe: [#Coyl114] Primal cue released by (for example) parental loss gives higher motivation.

You can do this too: [#Coyl101] Remember the one-minute mile: the many who broke it quickly after Bannister didn't just do it because of 'positive thinking', but because they knew it was possible and then tried. It may also have helped that Bannister was not considered to have an impossibly god-like talent.

You're behind-keep up!: [#Coyl116] May be a primal cue too. [# http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100615141749.htm] Ringers help in factories, as long as they perform better than the others, are leaders (who don't downtune their performance) and are observable by the others, for example if workers face each other.

You're special: [#59sec138] Being hard to get or being too easy does not help to get dates; it seems best to seem choosy but be specifically enthusiastic about the other. {EW: might hamper teachers to stimulate all students}

Young people: [#KNCV] Children prefer to be taught by young people (presumably young, attractive people; though adults may have the same preference, even though such people are only about 1-2% of the total population)

Young talent locations: [#Tonn78] Note that some locations like young talent, others want more experienced people; find the right level. TMF is a great place to be discovered, MTV is more for if you've already made it. Try to get into the right place for your CV and skill level {EW though no need to be too modest}

Yousafzai, Malala: [#NRC041113] Kind of pushed (or inspired?) by her father (a human rights activist) to become a political spokesfigure. Sort of political Leopold Mozart?

Zeeman, Pieter: Son of a vicar, worked under Kamerlingh Onnes, had Faraday as role model; when KO was on holiday did experiment of magnetism on light; Lorentz explained it theoretically.

Zegers, Kees: [#Int281011] Was very thorough: when he was a toilet cleaner, ensured that the toilets were spotless. Father taught him: stay within your budget. And surround yourself with people who are better in their work than you are (made best employee of his competitor director). Thinks that companies fail because the people running them are not good enough. Was flexible: once made error of 'oh, we can do it' but realized after 1.5 year that there was no good idea behind it.

Zeigarnik effect: [#Wiki] People remember things that are not completed better than completed things (like waiters remembering unpaid orders better than paid ones). Is also one of the mechanisms that fuels the 'just a few minutes' trick.

Zenji, Hakuin: [#Greene112] Later Zen master, was very anxious as a young man. In his time in Zen it was deemed too overbearing and invastive to give students any direction; they were supposed to find their own way to enlightenment. Result: students in state of rest and lethargy. Monks everywhere had convinced themselves that Zen was easy and simple, and that whatever felt right was right. Was taught by Shoju, who treated him hashly. Hakuin was fierce, determined and hungry for enlightenment. Most students inevitably stop somewhere, hearing an idea and holding onto it until it becomes dead. 'Without suffering and doubt, the mind will come to rest on clichés and stay there, until the spirit dies as well.

Zeweil, Ahmed: [#Hargit114] Sensed teacher as something holy, felt unfriendly atmosphere (ignorantly brought gift for professor) and immersed himself in learning everything in sight.

Zwagerman, Joost: [#Busa61] From age 10, made a weekly magazine, the 'Zwagergids'. Discovered at highschool that words could influence the surly school conrector. Read one book every evening during his teacher education. Then went on to study Dutch, which wasn't a really encouraging environment; continued writing, received many rejections, but in the end the first acceptation came. Likes 'empty' days; rewarded himself by going to town to eat, punished himself by letting himself cook dinner.

‘Postmortem’: [#Catmul218] One format (though one needs to vary) is lists of top-5 things to do again, top-5 things to not do again.

“Astonish me”: The best piece of advice that Paul Arden said to have received.

“Choking”: [#EricB513] (Expert) sporters losing skill when consciously paying attention to a part of it. [#Syed173] This basically 'dechunks' the skill, overloading working memory, making everything slow, and makes the transitions especially error-prone. You can choke indeed by paying attention to part of the action (activating the prefrontal cortex, like novices do), such as how high your racket swings. {Syed blames too much focus; I'd say: focus on the wrong parts! Such focus is only useful when learning...} Note that pressure (such as audience) can actually improve beginners by making them more focused/motivated. [#NS090711] In sports chokers, distracting yourself (for example with a nursery rhyme or counting backwards in threes] can help.

“I don't know-state”: [#Weiner196] [EW] Exercise in being in the 'I don't know state?'

“Outside-in-learning”: [#EW/IM] Sometimes, books on a subject are too specialist to be interesting, or even blog-posts, you have to write a lot yourself about the problem that X solves.

“Rogue” needs: [#SteelArt] Needs that are not ordinarily fulfilled at work can negatively affect performance.

“Status-society”: [#EW] Spanish, Chinese and Turkish had basically status society – court. Big, wealthy lands with lots of hierarchy and bureaucracy. Status became more important than hard work and virtue
